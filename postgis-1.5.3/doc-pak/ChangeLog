2010-01-15 18:41  pramsey

	* Short circuit on distance tests: only do full spheroidal
	  calculation where the distance is near or greater than the
	  tolerance. This will make large st_dwithin() radius searches much
	  faster since points that are well within the radius will not have
	  their full geodetic calculation run, only those that are close to
	  the radius boundary.

2010-01-15 18:06  pramsey

	* Prepare for 1.5.0b2

	* Add comment about postgis_comments.sql handling in 'clean' target
	  of docs

2010-01-12 01:00  pramsey

	* Don't remove postgis_comments.sql when doing a 'make clean' in
	  doc, that way they can survive into the tarball build for final
	  release.

2010-01-12 00:25  pramsey

	* Performance tweak to distance calculations with tolerance. If
	  distance is much less than tolerance, don't bother with geodetic
	  calculation. If distance is close to or greater than tolerance,
	  do the geodetic calculation. Should make st_dwithin faster,
	  avoiding geodetic calculations for points that are clearly within
	  tolerance.

2010-01-11 17:31  kneufeld

2009-12-30 15:12  robe

	  outputting double precision coords instead of float4. Still need
	  to fix up examples.

2009-12-30 14:52  mcayland

	* Fix ST_Envelope() and ST_Expand() so that they use double
	  precision arithmetic rather than single precision arithmetic for
	  their calculations. The internal BOX2DFLOAT4s should *never* be
	  used for calculation purposes.

2009-12-30 13:08  robe

	* ST_Box back to Box link ref

2009-12-30 12:53  robe

2009-12-28 13:32  mcayland

2009-12-15 20:08  pramsey

	  defines a common API within shp2pgsql-core that can be called
	  from both the CLI and GUI interfaces.
	  
	  There are still some minor TODOs left, however the basic concept
	  appears to work well and I've also spent time running tests under
	  valgrind to ensure that we don't leak memory on larger
	  shapefiles.

2009-12-09 17:33  kneufeld

	* added identifier to shp2pgsql usage section

	  behind the times. Use cutesy unicode dingbats for now -- alos put

2009-11-26 17:55  mcayland

	* Fix #316: IsValid? called on invalid 3d object leads to crash.
	  Because of the way the parser works, not all tuples can hold a
	  valid parse position; hence when trying to display the error
	  message, the parser would crash. The solution I went for here was
	  to alter pop() so that "counting tuples" always hold a valid
	  parse position, and then re-write the various check functions to
	  ensure that they only display parse errors with details from the
	  next "counting tuple" higher up in the stack.

2009-11-26 16:52  robe

	* change shortestline/longestline point/line example

	  postgis_comments.sql.xsl accordingly

	  postgis.xml rather than reference.xml in doc/xsl/* files. Add
	  template rule in doc/xsl/* to only use
	  /book/chapter[@id='reference'].

2009-11-19 20:23  pramsey

	  co-linear in point-in-polygon test.

	* Alter regression test harness so that shp2pgsql/pgsql2shp can be

2009-11-18 17:19  kneufeld

	  regressions from other platforms.

2009-11-17 14:00  mcayland

	* Properly fix #219 by creating a separate "mini install" of
	  PostGIS into the PGXS regression directory that can be used for
	  regression. This is because different architectures have
	  different naming conventions, and so Paul's original hack isn't
	  guaranteed to work. By using PGXS to perform the install, we
	  eliminate the problem of having to know the final architecture
	  library name.

	* put availability note first in what's new for 1.5. Some of the
	  functions aren't new but support geography or have behavior
	  change. Easier if that note comes first. Will change for prior
	  what's new later if this looks okay.

2009-11-10 12:18  robe

	* using (T) to denote Paul's transform hacks and noting what that

	  geometry.

2009-10-18 21:15  pramsey

	* Add in support for magic srid numbers that will always be

2009-10-15 17:50  mcayland

	* Update the TYPMOD_SET_* macros in the same way as for the

	  script to the repo.

2009-10-15 17:44  mcayland

	* Fix for column intersection geography queries sometimes returning
	  "lwgeom_get_gbox_geodetic: non-geodetic gbox provided" during

	  Paul's test dataset anymore.

2009-10-14 16:22  mcayland

	* HAck fix for NaN areas.

2009-10-11 02:03  pramsey

	  code.

2009-10-07 12:16  mcayland

	  within LWGEOM_makeline_garray.

2009-10-07 11:52  robe

	* Add table with multiple nulls to garden of geometries.
	  Evidentally -- there are some NULL bugs that escape trapping with

	  disjoint

2009-10-06 16:16  mcayland

	* First attempt at porting the estimate_selectivity() function to
	  handle 3 dimensions. Note this is mostly untested at the moment,
	  as this is only the function that cuts the relevant section out
	  of the histogram. We still need to plug this into the PostgreSQL
	  infrastructure.

2009-10-06 13:51  mcayland

	* Fix #258: ST_HausdorffDistance crashes server. Another geometry
	  free typo (same as #241) in both st_hausdorffdistance() and
	  st_hausdorffdistancedensify().

2009-10-06 13:43  mcayland

2009-10-06 08:52  mcayland

	* Move CFLAGS after the PGXS include directive, so that the
	  autotools configuration doesn't getting overwritten by the PGXS
	  version. Required when passing custom compiler f
	  lags into PostGIS as reported by William Kyngesburye.

	* Add untested new p-i-p approach for more testing later.

2009-10-05 16:17  mcayland

	* Commit first attempt at a multi-D statistics histogram builder.
	  Note that while geodetic data is inherently 3D, the builder also
	  contains code to handle lower dimension cartesian coordinates,
	  which should make porting to ggeometry easier at a later date. At
	  the moment there are no selectivity routines which actually use
	  the histograms for real queries, however a reasonably convincing
	  histogram is created in pg_statistic and all regression tests
	  pass here.

2009-10-05 14:37  pramsey

	* Increase precision.

2009-10-05 14:37  pramsey

	  upped required to 8.3

2009-09-22 11:23  robe

	* cut in Paul's geography.txt into the official docs. Didn't notice

	  built-in.

2009-09-17 15:44  robe

	* Revise garden test to include testing for creating geography

	  schema references.

2009-09-14 10:54  mcayland

	* Merge Paul's geodetic (geography) branch into trunk, as per
	  discussions on postgis-devel. Most of the merge was automatic
	  (albeit quite slow), with a few manual touch-ups where the merge
	  algorithm couldn't handle this automatically. "make check" runs
	  and passes, so I hope I haven't managed to break too much ;)

2009-07-08 04:59  mcayland

	* Fix #112: ST_CurveToLine sometimes crashes server. While the
	  circle segmentiser detected colinear circle points, it didn't
	  check for the
	  NULL pointer returned in this case. Since we are converting to a

	  as s
	  tandard line points.

2009-07-08 04:48  mcayland

	* Fix #183: ST_LineToCurve gives getPoint4d_p offset error. This

	  to have minimum 8.2 for windows and not for Linux as well)

2009-06-04 15:20  robe

	* change ReadME and installation to change minimum version from 8.1
	  to 8.2 (not many people are running 8.1 and besides Paul already
	  put in a DROP AGG IF EXISTS in upgrade script -- so binds us to
	  8.2+ already. Besides I don't think we should be supporting more
	  than 2 versions behind of latest PostgreSQL release in our trunk.
	  Too much maintenance. Correct ReadME bug tracker link

2009-05-26 18:00  kneufeld

	* added postgis_comments.sql as a target to the main makefile
	  
	  Since we don't want to add xsltproc as a dependency, this will
	  remain separate for now:
	  make comments
	  make comments-install
	  
	  (the file should be removed by 'make uninstall')

2009-05-22 22:07  kneufeld

	* formatted installation.xml in preparation for editing

2009-05-22 21:32  kneufeld

	* added the xmlformatter conf file for pretty printing the
	  documentation's xml files
	  
	  This will allow us to separate code changes from style changes in
	  the docs.

2009-05-20 11:16  robe

	* Testing out Kevin's auto image generator hopefully I didn't break
	  it.

2009-05-20 10:54  robe

	  showing a multicurve and flag as working for multicurves

2009-05-19 20:49  kneufeld

2009-05-19 03:44  robe

	  since they serve similar purposes

2009-05-14 23:42  kneufeld

	* added styles to the generated documentation images
	  added ImageMagick as a dependency

2009-05-09 12:53  mcayland

	* Fix #178: ST_XMax() and ST_YMax() return incorrect values. This
	  was caused by the fact that the min/max routines did not check
	  whether the result for each axis was actually the min or max, but
	  instead simply returned the structure value. Hence if an inverted
	  coordinate system were being used, the wrong value would be
	  returned.

2009-05-09 12:34  mcayland

	* Remove a double-free bug caused if the unparser finds an invalid
	  geometry (fixes #168)

2009-05-09 11:46  mcayland

	* Correct erroneus formatting which was causing two comments to be

2009-05-06 23:20  kneufeld

	* dropping a table that's not there causes an ERROR in the logs
	  - 8.1 does not support DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, so first test if the
	  table is there, then drop it.

2009-04-28 19:13  colivier

	* Add a new option for ST_AsGML related to axis order, and lat lon
	  inversion in GML 3.1.1, cf #161. Add unit test on this new option
	  bit field. Update documentation. Fix also wrong option value in
	  ST_AsGML for CRS, and outdated example output (still for
	  ST_AsGML).

2009-04-28 17:04  kneufeld

2009-04-27 16:09  robe

	* revise to better guarantee a deteriministic sort so can diff
	  compare between 1.3.5, 1.3.6, 1.4 (still needs work). Also
	  exclude curved tests and functions not supported in 1.3.5 since
	  it curve crashes 1.3.5 thus making it not comparable.

2009-04-22 18:33  robe

	* revise to include a version variable and get rid of limit (think
	  its causing different tests to be run non-consistently depending
	  on ordering of postgresql so hard to compare outputs)

	* More info about XSL in final configure output

2009-04-14 06:42  robe

2009-04-12 11:16  mcayland

	  syntax'. Remember that not everyone's installation has
	  "standard_conforming_strings" enabled by default.

2009-04-12 10:56  mcayland

	* Fix bug #148 'envelope() doesn't support new box3d_extent type'.
	  Looks like we do need to add casts for box3d_extent to all of
	  box2dfloaat, box3d and geometry after all.

2009-04-12 05:25  robe

	* missed some

2009-04-12 05:14  robe

	* Add ST_ContainsProperly to exclude for 1.3 testing.

2009-04-12 04:10  robe

	* Add new function ST_ContainsProperly and provide examples. Also
	  update ST_Contains to better explain the subtleties of the
	  definition and example to demonstrate the difference between
	  contains and containsproperly

2009-04-10 08:27  mcayland

	* Make good on my promise from bug #123 to remove the E'...'
	  escaping from shp2pgsql and revert to standard SQL escaping. Also
	  rename protect_quote_string() and make_good_string() to
	  escape_insert_string() and escape_copy_string() respectively so
	  the names reflect what they actually do.

2009-04-06 17:31  pramsey

	* Fix for previous commit; move the locations of the CASTs so that
	  they are after the definitions. Thanks Olivier!

2009-03-29 00:34  mcayland

	* Add additional casts for box3d_extent to box3d/box2d so that
	  other PostGIS functions can use the output of ST_Extent. Per
	  report from Olivier Courtin related to GBT#93.

2009-03-24 19:05  colivier

	* suppress compilation warning on non initialized variable

2009-03-22 06:43  pramsey

	* Back for more punishment: if we can checkin config.sub and
	  config.guess, we can check in ltmain.sh. Autotools, I despise
	  thee.

2009-03-22 06:30  pramsey

	* OK, didn't like that. libtoolize alters config.guess and
	  config.sub,
	  but removing them breaks build. Run libtoolize by hand and add
	  the resultants
	  to svn?

2009-03-22 06:28  pramsey

	* config.guess back?

2009-03-22 03:34  pramsey

	* config.sub back in?

2009-03-22 03:23  pramsey

	* Add lidar item

2009-03-16 23:06  mcayland

	* More cleanup work based upon Mateusz's MSVC patches; remove
	  references to unistd.h and sys/param.h since they are no longer
	  required for determining endian-ness.

2009-03-13 13:11  robe

	* switch order

2009-03-13 13:09  robe

	* get rid of sT_PolyFromWKB reference. Will readd those stupid ones
	  left in reference.xml later

2009-03-13 13:08  robe

	* more spots

2009-03-13 13:05  robe

	* missed a spot

2009-03-13 12:53  robe

	* remove using_postgis and reference and add using_postgis_dataman,
	  using_postgis_app

2009-03-13 12:11  robe

	* Break using_postgis into 2 sections, remover reference.xml from
	  doc make

2009-03-12 23:20  robe

	* #HISTORY #GBT 121: update tiger_geocoder to run in PostgreSQL 8.3
	  - apply patch from cdwinslow

2009-03-11 05:31  kneufeld

	* updated SQL/MM specs in ST_PointFromWKB

2009-03-11 05:13  kneufeld

2009-03-10 21:29  mcayland

	* More MSVC fixes from Mateusz related to ISO C++ vs. C99 variable
	  initialisation.

2009-03-10 21:05  colivier

	* updated SVG unit to reduce to max 2 decimal digits

2009-03-10 21:03  pramsey

	* MSVC line

2009-03-10 20:49  colivier

	* Add SVG unit test file

2009-03-10 20:42  pramsey

	* Add 1.3.5 release notes into trunk docs

2009-03-10 20:37  pramsey

	* First cut of 1.4 release notes.

2009-03-10 20:25  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#132: Make check should run CUnit. This is to aid
	  developers as we move the majority of the testing framework over
	  to CUnit.

2009-03-10 20:15  mcayland

	* Commit Mateusz's patch to move the postgres.h #include to the top
	  of the file in order to aid the MSVC build.

2009-03-10 20:15  colivier

	* update GML unit test according to AsGML option related to CRS
	  output option

2009-03-10 19:37  mcayland

	* Remove compiler warning from commit r3821.

2009-03-10 19:30  colivier

	* Update unit test upon previous GeoJson CRS change

2009-03-10 19:29  mcayland

	* Update PostGIS trunk so that the minimum required version of GEOS
	  is 3.0.0. This allows us to finally remove all remaining
	  compilation warnings since we can adjust the casts to make
	  correct use of the GEOS 3.0.0 header types.

2009-03-10 18:20  colivier

	* Fix GeoJson CRS output format (1.0 spec). Add OGC long CRS format
	  (Cf RFC 5165) as an option. On AsGeoJson it change option order
	  from 1.3.X between Bbox and CRS. On AsGML a new option parameter
	  is added

2009-03-10 17:24  mcayland

	* Some documentation updates; change the instructions for
	  decompressing the tarballs for PROJ and GEOS so that they work
	  for our Solaris friends (as per the instructions for the main
	  PostGIS tarball). Also move version entities for GEOS and PROJ
	  into postgis.xml, so that as newer versions of PROJ/GEOS are
	  released, we only need to update the version number in one
	  location for the change to be reflected throughout the
	  installation documentation.

2009-03-10 16:26  mcayland

	* Augment comment related to Paul's fix for GBT#130 as I'm bound to
	  forget why we decided to do this at a later date...

2009-03-10 16:24  colivier

	* Add circstring release and LWGEOM conversion entry

2009-03-10 16:18  mcayland

	* Remove some GCC-isms from the unparser related to setting array
	  sizes at run-time rather than compile time. Per report from
	  Mateusz Loskot.

2009-03-10 15:54  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#126: Don't include private PROJ.4 header projects.h. It
	  appears that from its inception, PostGIS has inadvertently used
	  the PROJ.4 internal projects.h header file rather than the
	  correct proj_api.h header file. This patch flips over to the new
	  header file and changes everything over to use the new external
	  structures/APIS.

2009-03-10 15:12  pramsey

	* Fix for GBT #130, remove bdpoly regression failure.

2009-03-10 15:06  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#89: transform() grid-shift 2nd chance logic
	  defective. Remove the 2nd chance logic completely and allow the
	  user to configure the behaviour using the standard PROJ.4
	  +nadgrids parameter. I've added a section to the ST_Transform()
	  section of the manual which gives an example of how you can do
	  this.

2009-03-10 14:59  colivier

	* Add SVG L Command in absolute path according to BNF SVG Path. Add
	  some forgotten geometry release.

2009-03-10 00:29  mleslie

	* Moving parser changes from spike/mleslie/parser to allow the
	  proper nesting of compound curves within curve polygons and the
	  validation of compound curve continuity. This also resolves
	  GBT#124.

2009-03-09 22:01  pramsey

	* Don't segmentize geometry if input doesn't pass hasarc

2009-03-09 21:15  robe

	* Put ST_CurveToLine back in script. Seems to not crash anymore
	  with Paul's changes to GBT: 112

2009-03-09 18:40  pramsey

	* Fix for GBT#96.

2009-03-09 17:19  mcayland

	* Fix the OSGB 27700 SRID definition in spatial_ref_sys.sql since
	  it is missing a datum parameter. We can't backpatch this since it
	  is only available in newer versions of PROJ, and we don't have
	  any PROJ version detection capability in 1.3 branch.

2009-03-09 16:20  mcayland

	* Remove compile warnings from lwgeom_dump.c related to the removal
	  of TupleDescGetSlot (we don't need to set the deprecated fields
	  in FuncCallContext if we are using BuildTupleFromCStrings).

2009-03-09 15:34  pramsey

	* More camel-case changes.

2009-03-09 14:51  colivier

	* Refactored the whole assvg export function in the same way than
	  asgeojson. Fix #119 issue on big geometrycollection geometry.
	  Keep the same SVG output than before

2009-03-09 14:36  pramsey

	* Remove some camelCase function signatures from liblwgeom

2009-03-08 22:33  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#93: ST_Extent() and ST_Estimated_Extent() return
	  BOX2DFLOAT4s. This is currently done using a horrible hack for
	  backwards compatibility which introduces a new type just for
	  ST_Extent(). See GBT email to postgis-devel and code comments for
	  more detail.

2009-03-08 21:41  pramsey

	* Fix goof in box2d computation.

2009-03-08 21:15  pramsey

	* Fix for GBT#112

2009-03-08 17:00  mcayland

	* Add some explanation comments to lwgeom_accum.c explaining why we
	  need to implement our own set of geometry aggregate functions.

2009-03-08 16:36  mcayland

	* Alter the in-built casts between the internal PostgreSQL BOX type
	  and the PostGIS geometry/BOX3D types so that they do not go
	  through an intermediate BOX2DFLOAT4 first. This prevents the
	  float4 rounding errors appearing in the numbers when invoking the
	  casts.

2009-03-08 15:37  pramsey

	* Fix for GBT #116, EMPTY hex polygon no longer causes crash.

2009-03-08 14:36  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#122: ST_SnapToGrid gives 13 when fed circular string.
	  Alter the error message so that it correctly displays the type
	  rather than just it's internal number.

2009-03-06 14:15  robe

	* missing svn tags and copyright info

2009-03-03 18:01  robe

	* Flag ST_GeoHash as curved support friendly, put in pretty anchors

	  precisions (odd and even)

2009-02-27 18:09  robe

	* Get rid of additional calls to TupleDescGetSlot(tupdesc) in dump
	  and dumprings and replace deprecated use of TupleDescGetSlot with
	  8.1+ preferred BlessTupleDesc

2009-02-23 15:19  strk

	* Fix parse_hex to support lower-case A-F too (issue 120)

2009-02-23 13:47  robe

	  enhancements. Add space before availability in xsl parser what is
	  new section

	* Add special section listing new functions in this release. Get
	  rid of note tag around ST_GeoHash availability so consistent with
	  other availability text

2009-02-13 06:58  robe

	* 

2009-02-12 18:32  robe

	* more work on comments generation

	* Change references from ./lwgeom to ./postgis

2009-02-11 18:22  pramsey

	* Change the name of the main source directory. This is going to
	  break the build for a little while until I fix all the
	  references, but I want to do it atomically to ensure version
	  history is preserved.

2009-02-11 02:11  pramsey

	* GeoHash implementation first cut.

2009-02-10 21:20  pramsey

	* KML output: use decimal places rather than significant digit,
	  trim trailing zeros, update documentation, update unit test

2009-02-10 07:54  colivier

	* GeoJson output: trim trailing zero, add forgotten free on
	  subgemotry inspect. GML output: precision no more as a global
	  one, decimal places rather than significant digits, trim trailing
	  zero, add unit test, doc update with output example

2009-02-09 23:51  pramsey

2009-02-03 19:09  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#109: Some operators not supported for Circular. In this
	  case I haven't added the comparison code as I am not 100% sure on
	  the semantics, but the error message should be much clearer to
	  users now.

2009-02-03 17:49  robe

	* Add corrections from Bruce Rindahl

	  geometries with LINESTRING,POINT convex hulls

2009-02-03 14:21  robe

	* First draft of ST_MinimumBoundingCircle contributed by Bruce
	  Rindahl. Changed to use named params and renamed function from
	  mbc to ST_MinimumBoundingCircle.

2009-01-22 01:39  pramsey

	* First stab at a back-port of the array_agg from 8.4. Our's isn't
	  generic, and it's got it's own name, so it won't collide, ...
	  needs testing on PgSQL < 8.3 still.

2009-01-22 01:16  kneufeld

2009-01-20 00:50  kneufeld

	* Fixed accidental broken build in docs from Rev3536.

2009-01-19 21:33  pramsey

	* First revision of the GUI. Configure using --with-gui to enable

2009-01-16 17:58  robe

	* move ST_GeomCollFromText

2009-01-16 17:41  robe

	* Move st_mpolyfromtext

2009-01-15 21:11  robe

	* Left some garbage in

2009-01-15 18:35  mcayland

	* Part 1 of GBT#94: Rename folders/files to be more consistent.
	  Embed the MAJOR.MINOR version in the PostgreSQL shared library
	  name (to allow different databases to contain different PostGIS
	  versions) and also rename lwpostgis.sql to postgis.sql. Update
	  documentation in various files to reflect the new names at the
	  same time.

2009-01-15 18:24  robe

	* Move ST_MLineFromText

2009-01-15 18:17  robe

	* more stuff

2009-01-15 18:16  robe

	* forgot some stuff

2009-01-15 18:14  robe

	* Move over MPointFromText

2009-01-15 15:10  mcayland

	* Fix the output of "SELECT postgis_full_version()" on trunk by
	  ensuring that USE_STATS is present, and correctly generating the
	  POSTGIS_SCRIPTS_VERSION variable so that installations of trunk
	  don't keep thinking that they need a scripts upgrade.

2009-01-14 17:46  pramsey

	* Remove missing prototype warning from build.

2009-01-13 15:12  robe

	* Error in logic in gardentest not correctly flagging WKT functions
	  as taking geometry variant

	  'Curve' to 'CircularString')

2009-01-13 14:04  robe

	* Move over ST_PolygonFromText

2009-01-13 13:12  mcayland

	* Fix compile warnings for the cunit tests (unused variables).

2009-01-13 13:00  mcayland

	* Update lwgeom_gettypename() by renaming Curve to CircularString.
	  Now lots of error messages scattered throughout liblwgeom should
	  start to make sense...

2009-01-13 12:59  mcayland

	* Rearrange liblwgeom.h as per Paul's comment on GBT#97: Rename
	  LWCURVE to LWCIRCSTRING. Also rename lwfree_circstring() to
	  lwcircstring_free() so that it matches the others (I guess this
	  was missed in the first pass).

2009-01-13 12:27  mcayland

	* Commit for GBT#97: Rename LWCURVE to LWCIRCSTRING (also know as
	  restoring balance to the universe).
	  
	  Having gone through and re-read sections of the CIRCULARSTRING
	  code, it is amazing how much easier the code is to read without
	  the confusion of a curve being either a CIRCULARSTRING or
	  LINESTRING as per the SQL-MM spec. The resulting commit compiles
	  & installs cleanly for me, passes "make check" and also Regina's
	  torture script. Please let me know if I accidentally broke
	  anything :)

2009-01-12 19:29  pramsey

	* Remove double-free problem from loader in presence of new
	  deep-freeing lwfree calls.

2009-01-12 14:38  robe

	* typos

2009-01-12 14:24  robe

	* Correct. ST_LinestringFromText does not exist though was
	  documented before.

2009-01-12 13:54  robe

	* Move over ST_Line functions and point out how pointless they are.
	  Also correct incorrect statement that they throw errors when
	  given non-line - they just return null.

2009-01-12 12:23  mcayland

	* Remove erroneus merge from r3502 (HAVE_CUNIT_H just isn't defined
	  anymore...)

2009-01-11 07:10  pramsey

	* Remove RECHECK per GBT#18.

2009-01-09 23:04  robe

	* Fix typo

2009-01-09 22:52  robe

	* Move over rest of miscellaneous -- NOTE st_find_srid does not
	  exist - was never renamed from find_srid. Not sure its worth
	  fixing since its rarely used anyway.

2009-01-09 19:17  pramsey

	* Rename lwfree_inspected to lwinspected_release, per it's "shallow
	  free" behavior.

2009-01-09 17:41  pramsey

	* Rename lwfree_* to *_free.

2009-01-09 14:15  robe

	* Missed some ST_ spots.

2009-01-09 13:49  robe

	* Missed a spot.

2009-01-09 13:48  robe

	* Using - fix some connectiontype omissions in Mapserver section,
	  add in processing defer comment, fix some missing ST_

2009-01-09 13:32  robe

	* Add circular string note

2009-01-09 13:29  robe

	* Move over ST_NRings

2009-01-09 13:17  robe

	* Move over ST_Zmflag

2009-01-08 17:22  pramsey

	* Forgot to save this file. Also changes to lwfree_* *_release.

2009-01-08 17:04  pramsey

	* Alter lwfree_* to deep-free memory. Add variants of *_release to
	  support shallow-free. Go through lwgeom/ and replace any lwfree_*
	  instances with *_release where appropriate. (Surprisingly few.)

2009-01-08 16:06  robe

	* documentatioin out of synch with reality since garden test
	  failing. Change spelling ST_CrossingDirection to new name
	  ST_LineCrossingDirection

2009-01-08 15:50  robe

	* put in valid name space (giving error with my xsltproc otherwise)

2009-01-07 19:40  robe

	* Finish off adding multi garden geometries

2009-01-07 18:25  kneufeld

	* updated documention on addgeometrycolumn, clarifying the errors
	  thrown.

2009-01-07 12:11  mcayland

	* Bump some LWDEBUG(F) from level 1 up to levels 3-4 (level 1 is
	  reserved)

2009-01-07 01:16  pramsey

	* Remove memory leak in standard loader.

2009-01-05 20:54  mcayland

	* Allow CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS parameters from the command line to be
	  passed into the CUnit Makefile, since CUnit is the only
	  dependency that cannot determine its own flags using a --with-X
	  parameter. This allows CUnit to be installed in a non-standard
	  location if required.

2009-01-05 14:44  robe

	* Put circular back in mix. Doesn't crash now that MCA changed
	  distance to throw error.

2009-01-05 00:08  mcayland

	* Rework the CUnit detection infrastructure as you can't locate
	  include files based on an absolute path. This is because autoconf
	  and the compiler have differing ideas of the current paths (this
	  totally breaks the Win32 build since you have the extra mapping
	  between UNIX-type MingW paths and Windows-type paths). Hopefully
	  this should not affect existing users at all - if so, please post
	  a report on -devel. I'll try running this on MingW at a later
	  date.
	  
	  I've also enforced "make check" to run the unit tests, rather
	  than "make test". This is a fallout from the early days when strk
	  committed the regression test suite to run using "make test" by
	  accident which appears to have stuck :(
	  .

2009-01-04 20:39  mcayland

	* Fix comment in lwgeom_from_ewkt() and also add a quick error
	  check to lwgeom_from_ewkt() and lwgeom_from_ewkb() - otherwise
	  upon parse failure we could pass a half-baked geometry back to
	  the caller which would not be good :(

2009-01-04 20:11  mcayland

	* Update the cunit tests to use the proper parser flag
	  PARSER_CHECK_NONE rather than the hard-coded zero.

2009-01-04 19:54  mcayland

	* Add -lm to the cu_tester link line - we must always add this to
	  the link line for anything that links agains liblwgeom.a (at
	  least on my Linux system here)

2009-01-04 19:24  mcayland

	* Commit quick fix for GBT#85: ST_Distance crashes on Circular
	  String. Rather than devise and implement a set of distance
	  functions for CIRCULARSTRINGs, I've simply added code to detect
	  the condition and throw an "Unsupported geometry type" error,
	  similar to as already exists within the codebase.

2009-01-02 13:25  robe

	* minor update

2009-01-02 13:23  robe

	* Add ST_DumpPoints. Not sure how simple it is.

2009-01-01 21:36  robe

	* Put time stamp placeholder on (I think)

2009-01-01 21:26  robe

	* Fix typo

2009-01-01 00:31  pramsey

	* Fix based on test case from MAC.

2008-12-27 22:58  pramsey

	* Add support for multilinestring to st_locatebetweenelevations

2008-12-27 08:08  pramsey

	* Add heat map case.

2008-12-24 20:15  pramsey

	* Add mline version of clipper.

2008-12-24 17:37  pramsey

	* Add lwfree_geom to generically deep-free lwgeometries.

2008-12-24 17:09  pramsey

	* Add lwgeom_from_ewkt and change larger cunit tests to create
	  candidate geometries from text instead of by hand.

2008-12-24 00:32  mcayland

	* Try and commit a pre-generated output from flex that works for
	  the build-bot.

2008-12-23 22:11  pramsey

	* Revert accidental commit of lex.yy.c

2008-12-23 20:20  pramsey

	* Rename new functions to ST_LineCrossingDirection and
	  ST_LocateBetweenElevations for more explicitness and closer
	  correspondance to SQL/MM, respectively. Add a new geometry
	  counter for collections.

2008-12-23 13:24  robe

	* Break out multi as separate geometry types and start putting in.
	  Remove unary/aggregate geom since now exactly the same as section
	  that takes only 1 geometry.

2008-12-22 23:37  pramsey

	* Add CUnit to main 'make test' build and check for existance of
	  CUnit.h as part of ./configure

2008-12-22 21:49  mcayland

	* Fix typo in the backticks when extracting linker/include flags
	  from pg_config. Resolving this allows SVN trunk to compile on
	  MingW! :)

2008-12-22 17:49  robe

	* More typos

2008-12-22 17:48  robe

	* More typos

2008-12-22 17:47  robe

	* typo

2008-12-22 16:54  robe

	* Missed a constant

2008-12-22 16:53  robe

	* First draft of ST_CrossingDirection -- needs more work

2008-12-22 15:22  robe

	* More conditional corrections. Also take circular back out of test
	  since still crashes under 1.4 with ST_Distance.

2008-12-22 14:14  robe

	* Revision - change to not test geoms against other geoms if
	  function only takes one geom, better commenting of output. Put
	  back circularstring -- crashes on 1.3 still on ST_Distance in
	  some cases. Haven't tested against trunk

2008-12-22 12:15  mcayland

	* Remove the few C++-style comments that have crept into the
	  codebase, and add a note to the STYLE document stating that
	  C-style comments should be used.

2008-12-22 11:51  mcayland

	* Remove the WKB_CONVERSION hack which was invented to try and make
	  the JTS connector more reliable. Since all the other JTS code has
	  gone, this can now go too. See
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-August/003495.html
	  for a little discussion.

2008-12-22 11:38  mcayland

	* Errr.... unsigned *what* exactly??! If you'd have asked me
	  yesterday if I thought this would compile, I would have said
	  no...

2008-12-22 11:11  mcayland

	* Some code tidy-ups: remove Windows CR/LFs from the file, change
	  the free()s into lwfree()s, and fix a spelling mistake.

2008-12-22 09:30  robe

	* revert part of last change

2008-12-22 08:39  robe

	* correction to last edit

2008-12-21 06:37  pramsey

	* Add ST_LineClipZ(geometry, from, to) SQL and C functions.

2008-12-19 19:21  pramsey

	* Complete c-level line clipping routines, and unit tests.

2008-12-19 19:20  pramsey

	* Add in lwfree_* deep memory clean-up routines for multi-objects.

2008-12-19 18:51  kneufeld

	* Upgraded section in using_postgis.xml that talks about OGC
	  Simplicity / Validity.

2008-12-19 16:57  pramsey

	* Remove camelCase example from style guideline against camelCase
	  (! :)

2008-12-19 14:59  mcayland

	* Remove the PostGIS LWGEOM type constants from pgsql2shp - they
	  are no longer needed here as they are included as part of
	  liblwgeom.h.

2008-12-18 20:42  pramsey

	* Complete the pfree_ to lwfree_ renaming.

2008-12-18 20:36  pramsey

	* Move curve back down below curve struct. Hm.

2008-12-18 20:35  pramsey

	* Complete the pfree_* to lwfree_* renaming.

2008-12-18 20:30  pramsey

	* Rename pfree_* memory management function lwfree_*

2008-12-18 20:22  pramsey

	* Partial work commit for safety

2008-12-18 17:07  pramsey

	* Ignore generated Makefile

2008-12-18 15:58  robe

	* Revise to cross every geometry with every other to better test
	  the functions that take 2 geometries. This increases the
	  generated script to about 18 MB. Still need to trim off some of
	  these tests (since it does the same for singular geom functions)

2008-12-18 15:38  robe

	* Get rid of redundant variable declares

2008-12-18 15:32  robe

	* Get rid of 2 geom relation section. Its redundant now that the
	  last condition section has been improved.

2008-12-18 15:25  robe

	* Numerous enhancements to make torture script generator smarter -
	  e.g. don't use geometry select when function takes not
	  geometries, don't put monkey in when you see pattern matrix use a
	  real intersectionmatrix, concept of version

2008-12-18 00:54  pramsey

	* Partial work saved back for later.

2008-12-17 20:47  pramsey

	* Partial work into SVN where I can get at it elsewhere.

2008-12-17 20:22  pramsey

	* Remove LFs from regression files per MCA.

2008-12-17 19:37  mcayland

	* #HISTORY: Really fix what was broken in r3431/3432. See the notes
	  there for the full detail.

2008-12-17 18:20  pramsey

	* Re-locate cunit, add a STYLE guideline draft and some TODO notes.

2008-12-17 16:03  mcayland

	* Undo r3431/3432: this isn't ready for the primetime yet as it
	  breaks a couple of the regression tests.

2008-12-17 15:01  mcayland

	* Fix for one of Regina's torture failures as posted to the -devel
	  list here:
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-December/004362.html.
	  A CurvePolygon has a "standard header" and so must be passed
	  through a function that understands the optional existence of
	  SRIDs/BBOXes etc. in the header.

2008-12-17 05:36  pramsey

	* harmonize unit tests with new function names

2008-12-17 05:32  pramsey

	* harmonize function names so things... compile

2008-12-17 05:28  pramsey

	* Revisison per MCA and (c) headers.

2008-12-17 00:22  pramsey

	* Add some co-linearity tests.

2008-12-17 00:19  pramsey

	* Basic co-linearity support. Remove touching cases from
	  crossingdirection.

2008-12-16 23:43  pramsey

	* Add ST_CrossingDirection(line, line) bindings into SQL.

2008-12-16 22:29  pramsey

	* First cut of line crossing function, and associated cunit tests.

2008-12-16 21:21  kneufeld

	* fixed bug in probe_geometry_columns where an srid of -1 is not
	  properly detected. (last time :))

2008-12-16 21:11  kneufeld

	* fixed bug in probe_geometry_columns where an srid of -1 is not
	  properly detected.

2008-12-16 21:07  kneufeld

	* fixed bug in probe_geometry_columns where an srid of -1 is not
	  properly detected.

2008-12-16 16:22  robe

	* More changes - can't remember

2008-12-16 13:01  robe

	* Add cross reference to ST_IsValidReason on ST_IsValid and
	  ST_Summary

2008-12-16 12:40  robe

	* Fix formatting of ForceRHR args -- messing up torture test
	  generator

2008-12-15 14:50  robe

	* missing the st_geomfromtext among others because of bad
	  conditions - switched to xsl:choose to simplify logic.

2008-12-15 13:36  robe

	* minor comment addition

2008-12-15 12:56  robe

	* add more data types. Remove curve tests again -- too many
	  crashers

2008-12-15 12:36  robe

	* Typo in data type param

2008-12-15 10:30  mcayland

	* #HISTORY: Fix for GBT#83: "ST_Multi on curved polygon gives
	  ERROR: Unknown geometry type: 0". On reflection, ST_Multi() can
	  only operate on standard POINT, LINESTRING and POLYGON types as
	  the only MULTI geomtypes are MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING and
	  MULTIPOLYGON. This was caused by the introduction of the curve
	  crashing fixes in 1.3.4.

2008-12-15 05:33  robe

	* more cleanup

2008-12-15 05:03  robe

	* Think I got most of the functions with additional args, left out
	  circular since it crashes. We can fix in 1.4

2008-12-15 04:12  robe

	* replace param logic

2008-12-15 02:38  robe

	* #GBT 84: Fix typo in boundary error

2008-12-14 15:14  robe

	* Add circular string and curved polygon to garden set. Also start
	  work on dealing with functions that take floats and integers as
	  additional params

2008-12-14 07:24  robe

	* Exclude st_curvetoline from test for now. Crashes on geometry
	  collection test.

2008-12-14 03:19  robe

	* Add GEOMETRYCOLLECTION to garden mix. This crashes my 1.3.5SVN
	  build after running generated script - investigating

2008-12-14 03:10  robe

	* Add logic to test for unary functions that take box2d/3d and add
	  3d geometries to garden set.

2008-12-14 01:50  robe

	* Add create table, add geom, drop column, drop table to batch of
	  tortures

2008-12-13 19:48  pramsey

	* Remove isvalidreason, it's done.

2008-12-13 19:47  pramsey

	* Add typmod idea

2008-12-12 17:07  robe

	* Fix condition statement that prevented some 2 geom functions from
	  being picked up

2008-12-12 16:55  robe

	* Added POLYGONM gset to test. Also got rid of monkey crashing
	  LineMerge. May add back later by removing the NOT (j=i)
	  conditions.

2008-12-12 16:49  robe

	* Note that ST_MakePolygon can be used to make measured polys and
	  3d polys

2008-12-12 16:26  robe

	* use strcmp for compare instead of comparing first element in
	  projcreate

2008-12-12 14:20  robe

	* get rid of accidentally copied comment

2008-12-12 14:11  robe

	* Add relationship/ functions that act on 2 geometries tests to the
	  mix

2008-12-12 13:40  robe

	* Add POINTM and LINESTRINGM to garden family

2008-12-12 13:17  robe

	* Remove Postgis_JTS_Version from docs. No longer in 1.4 code base.

2008-12-12 13:05  robe

	* Revise to use an xml collection instead of repetitive loops. Also
	  put in select start and end so when the server crashes you know
	  where it broke.

2008-12-12 11:07  mcayland

	* Looks like I accidentally removed some code from LWGEOM_accum
	  that was required to set the Oid of the array being used to store
	  the aggregate results. As reported by Regina.

2008-12-11 19:38  robe

	* Fix typo in geometry test

2008-12-11 18:57  robe

	* put in the svn:keywords thingy and also update postgis_gardentest
	  to generate garden test for all unary postgis functions and
	  aggregates

2008-12-11 17:18  kneufeld

	* added a HINT to the ERROR message in errorIfGeometryCollection
	  indicating the geometry that is in error.

2008-12-11 16:56  robe

	* First draft of garden test sql generator. This version just
	  searches the docs and outputs tests for functions that take no
	  arguments. Need to formulate a list of geometries to generate
	  code for unary and so forth.

2008-12-11 15:56  robe

	* Incorporated Mark's suggestion to use PQescapeStringConn instead
	  of building a custom function. Also fixed typo. Note using free()
	  instead of PQfree since couldn't find a PQfree. I looked at the
	  8.3.5 postgresql source code base, and that's what they seem to
	  use when releasing buffer space.

2008-12-11 14:55  mcayland

	* Increase the amount of allocated memory by 3 bytes, so that if
	  maxlength < 3 and we return just "..." then we still have enough
	  space to store the string without clobbering memory.

2008-12-11 13:46  mcayland

	* Fix up a couple of errors in the new lwmessage_truncate()
	  function found by Kevin - correct an off-by-one error in the
	  code, and include a missing startpos offset in the end truncation
	  code. Also ensure that if maxlength gets too small then we return
	  "..." rather than crashing.

2008-12-10 12:36  mcayland

	* Resolve local merge conflict from previous commit.

2008-12-10 12:32  mcayland

	* Add new lwmessage_truncate() function to liblwgeom that will
	  truncate a string to a maximum number of characters, adding a
	  "..." to indicate where the string has been trimmed. Truncation
	  can be specified to occur from either the start or end of the
	  string as required. Also update the parser error handler to use
	  the new function.

2008-12-09 23:29  mleslie

	* Porting the floating point comparison operator upgrade from the
	  1.3 branch.

2008-12-07 02:52  robe

	* correct mm reference of ST_PointFromText and remove from old MM
	  section

2008-12-07 02:47  robe

	* Minor additions

2008-12-07 02:42  robe

	* fix some typos

2008-12-07 02:29  robe

	* Move over (x,y,z) min/max family and add cross reference to those
	  from ST_X, ST_Y, ST_Z

2008-12-07 00:40  robe

	* Move over ST_Box2D and ST_Box3D and flag ST_Accum as working with
	  circular strings

2008-12-05 19:39  robe

	* revise example

2008-12-05 19:31  robe

	* Clarify use of ST_Relation and include Martin's example of
	  interior intersects

2008-12-05 13:46  robe

	* #HISTORY: #GBT:34 - .prj creation by pgsql2shp

2008-12-04 17:01  robe

	* Move over rest of Long Transactions

2008-12-03 17:12  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#79: shp2pgsql does not honor -s (also known as Mark
	  accidentally missed the sr_id from the geometry constructors)

2008-12-03 16:02  mcayland

	* Lightbulb moment: the fix for GBT#21: locate_along_measure: wrong
	  values, invalid data required extra work as floating point errors
	  could still be introduced by the removal of the memcpy(). In fact
	  it was the clipping logic that was wrong, so this patch re-adds
	  the memcpy() in the correct place(s) and corrects the clipping
	  flags to remove this floating point error. With thanks to Stephen
	  Davies.

2008-12-02 20:04  robe

	* Remove some junk and fix some typos, rephrase descriptions

2008-12-02 20:00  robe

	* Move over LockRow

	  Editors

2008-11-28 16:38  pramsey

	* wrap isvalidreason in test for GEOS >= 3.1

2008-11-27 19:04  robe

	* correction

2008-11-27 18:53  robe

	* ST_IsValidReason typo and add an example of a valid geometry

2008-11-27 18:31  robe

	* Document new ST_IsValidReason function. I suppose this may be the
	  last time I can successfully create invalid geometries before
	  Mark ruins all the fun.

2008-11-26 19:04  pramsey

	* ST_IsValidReason(geometry) returns text reason for validity
	  failure.
	  Requires GEOS >= 3.1.
	  GBT#51

2008-11-26 13:40  mcayland

	* Apply patch from strk to prevent unneccesary invocation of 'ar'
	  when building liblwgeom.

2008-11-26 12:11  robe

	* Correct install docs to agree with README. Not sure if this is
	  necessary since this is partially for already installed postgis.
	  Are we going to have an lwgeom folder in contrib?

2008-11-26 11:49  mcayland

	* Create liblwgeom as a phony dependency, so that any changes to
	  liblwgeom cause a re-build of liblwgeom.a during "make". Patch
	  provided by strk.

2008-11-26 11:43  mcayland

	* Fix some minor errors in the README documentation as indicated by
	  strk.

2008-11-25 21:46  pramsey

	* Bring forward release notes from 1.3.4

2008-11-25 10:42  mcayland

	* Quick fix for GBT#72: ST_Estimated_Extent sometimes returns null
	  if table exists but not in current schema.

2008-11-24 13:18  robe

	* Fix indentation for estimated_extent example. Document
	  ST_Force_Collection broken when given Circular strings for
	  versions prior to 1.3.4

2008-11-24 11:04  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#73: ST_Force_Collection crashes with CIRCULARSTRING.
	  This is basically the same fix for GBT#66: ST_Dump kills backend
	  when fed CIRCULAR STRING except that it occurs in a different
	  place.

2008-11-24 11:01  mcayland

	* Move lwgeom_contains_subgeoms() into liblwgeom core as it seems
	  it is now required outside of lwgeom_dump.c.

2008-11-23 19:18  robe

	* Move over the rest of the ST_Force* family

2008-11-23 07:22  robe

	* Move over ST_Estimated_Extent

2008-11-23 06:54  robe

2008-11-21 14:28  robe

	* GBT #71: Update section 4.2 of docs to describe manual adding to
	  geometry columns - revision. Add pretty anchor, reference pretty
	  anchor in AddGeometryColumn reference section. Rearrange order.

2008-11-21 14:15  robe

	* GBT #71: Update section 4.2 of docs to describe manual adding to
	  geometry columns.
	  
	  Decided to just add a new section after

2008-11-21 08:32  robe

	* 

2008-11-21 08:31  robe

	* Move over ST_CoordDim

2008-11-20 22:03  mcayland

	* Located more profile calls using grep and converted them over to
	  use the new macros. Hopefully I've caught all of them now...

2008-11-20 18:45  mcayland

	* Found some new locations containing profiling code outside of the
	  GEOS functions, so swap them over to using the new macros.

2008-11-20 15:00  mcayland

	* Switch GEOS profiling over to use conditional macros, much in the
	  same way as LWDEBUG(F) has been implemented. This improves code
	  readability by not having constant #if...#endif sections
	  throughout the code. I've also changed the variable that
	  indicates whether profiling has been enabled to POSTGIS_PROFILE,
	  and integrated it into the autoconf configuration. Hence
	  profiling can be enabled by running configure with the
	  --enable-profile option, or setting POSTGIS_PROFILE in
	  postgis_config.h to 1 and re-compiling.

2008-11-20 13:32  robe

	* typo

2008-11-20 12:55  robe

	* Add note on ST_Transform and ST_AsKML that they require Proj
	  support

2008-11-19 13:40  robe

	* update doc on install to reference geos 3.0.3

2008-11-17 17:30  robe

2008-11-16 15:54  robe

	* typo

2008-11-15 20:33  robe

	* Move over ST_Polygon and ST_WKBToSQL, move ST_MakePolygon from
	  Geometry Processing to Geometry Constructors section

2008-11-14 23:46  robe

	* Move over rest of non-MM compliant Geometry Constructor functions

2008-11-12 17:42  pramsey

2008-11-10 15:48  pramsey

	* Fix error in prepgeomcache type

2008-11-08 14:43  robe

	* Document affine functions now work with curves. Though I don't
	  have a tool to verify correctness, so my assumption - it returns
	  something that sounds sort of right.

2008-11-08 14:17  robe

	* document more functions that work with circular strings

2008-11-08 06:46  robe

	* document support for curves of functions Mark C just fixed with
	  disclaimer only works in 1.3.4+

2008-11-07 17:07  pramsey

	* Prepared geometry mixed-types bug fix ported forward from 1.3.

2008-11-07 14:23  mcayland

	* After a quick sanity grep, I noticed that ST_Transform() was also
	  susceptible to crashing on curve types in the same way as the
	  previous two fixes. Hence I'm committing a fix now before Regina
	  finds it and logs another bug report :)

2008-11-07 14:21  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#69: ST_Translate crashes when fed circular string.
	  lwgeom_affine_recursive() needs to know about the new
	  lwgeom_getcurve_inspected() function.

2008-11-07 14:18  mcayland

	* Fix GBT#70: ST_NPoints Crashes with Curves. lwgeom_npoints()
	  needs to know about the new lwgeom_getcurve_inspected() function.

2008-11-07 14:05  mcayland

	* Add missing lwgeom_getcurve_inspected() function which is
	  required for some of the latest GBT fixes.

2008-11-07 07:44  robe

	* Yeh ST_Dump now works with curves

2008-11-06 17:16  mcayland

	* Add missing function prototype from r3263.

2008-11-06 17:05  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#66: ST_Dump kills backend when fed CIRCULAR STRING.
	  With thanks to Regina Obe.

2008-11-06 16:12  mcayland

	* The GEOS 2.2 series "geos_c.h" is missing header guards, so
	  including the header multiple times as is done in lwgeom_geos.h
	  and lwgeom_geos_prepared.h causes compilation to fail with
	  multiple definition errors. This patch fixes this problem
	  allowing GEOS 2.2 to work with PostGIS once again, although of
	  course it can easily be removed when it is decided that GEOS 2.2
	  support is no longer required.

2008-11-06 15:15  mcayland

	* Change configure to check for the existence of the PGXS Makefile,
	  even if pg_config can be found. This is become distributions such
	  as Debian install pg_config as part of libpq-dev but this package
	  doesn't contain the required Makefile. Per bug report from strk.

2008-11-05 13:03  robe

	* amend ST_Longitude bug comment

2008-11-05 11:29  mcayland

	* Fix ST_AsGML() not recognising GEOMETRYCOLLECTION as a valid
	  geometry type from my GBT#65 fix :(

2008-11-05 11:25  mcayland

	* Fix regression tests reporting incorrect failures due to a change
	  of output caused by r3243.

2008-11-05 11:06  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#68 - ST_Shift_Longitude doesn't work with MULTIPOINT.
	  Looks like this was just a simple mistake in the code. I've also
	  improved the error message to return the proper type name instead
	  of just a number.

2008-11-05 01:56  robe

	* add ST_Collect as having some support for circular

2008-11-04 20:26  robe

	* typo in proto

2008-11-04 20:05  robe

	* Add missing proto for ST_CurveToLine

2008-11-04 14:15  robe

	* Add ST_HasArc, pull some useful comments from source code to add
	  to ST_CurveToLine

2008-11-04 14:09  mcayland

	* Fix lwgeom_typename() not returning a valid string for any of the
	  newer geometry types.

2008-11-04 13:58  mcayland

	* Fix for GBT#65: ST_AsGML kills the backend when fed a CIRCULAR
	  STRING. The default code attempts to inspect any unknown geometry
	  which fails on CIRCULARSTRING. A longer term fix may be to fix
	  CIRCULARSTRING so that it can be inspected, however the fix here
	  is to throw an ERROR for unknown types just as the other As_*()
	  functions do.

2008-11-04 13:43  robe

	* Change all ST_AsKML to use new ST_Transform

2008-11-04 13:14  robe

	* More flagging of functions that work with 3d

2008-11-04 12:31  robe

	* fill in all protos for kml, flag more functions as supporting 3d
	  and circular/curve

2008-11-04 10:00  mcayland

	* Change ST_GeomFromText() to GeomFromText() for older hwgeom (-w)
	  support - looks like I was a little bit to eager in my earlier
	  conversion to use the new ST_ calling convention.

2008-11-04 09:57  mcayland

	* Alter loader Makefile to add liblwgeom.a dependency, so people
	  who just want to build the shapefile loaders can do "make" within
	  the loader subdirectory and liblwgeom.a will automagically get
	  build first.

2008-11-04 02:48  robe

	* fix typo

2008-11-04 02:19  robe

	* document circular support of more functions

2008-11-04 02:07  robe

	* Get rid of MM compliancy note for ST_LineToCurve, can only find
	  ST_CurveToLine in MM docs

2008-11-04 01:56  robe

	* correct comment

2008-11-04 01:55  robe

	* Add new section to document circular string support

2008-11-04 01:47  robe

	* Document ST_LineToCurve and ST_CurveToLine, update template to
	  include note about Circular String support in prep for new index
	  section

2008-11-03 17:00  kneufeld

	* updated url in comments to the documentation on the implemented
	  point-in-polygon algorithm to
	  http://softsurfer.com/Archive/algorithm_0103/algorithm_0103.htm#Winding%20Number.
	  Old link was dead.

2008-11-03 16:23  mcayland

	* Add missing ICONV_LDFLAGS variable to the loader Makefile. Thanks
	  to Olivier Courtin for noticing.

2008-11-03 16:17  mcayland

	* Switch pgsql2shp over to using liblwgeom.
	  
	  There are few commits that can be as satisfying as one which
	  involves the removal of ~1200 lines of code. By using the
	  liblwgeom parser instead of the in-built parser, we have now
	  achieved the following:
	  
	  i) all parsers within PostGIS, shp2pgsql and pgsql2shp are now
	  the same which means they all follow the same rules. Also
	  extended error reporting information including error text and
	  position information is available.
	  
	  ii) the complexity of the shp2pgsql/pgsql2shp is considerably
	  reduced.
	  
	  The slightly unfortunate cost is the overall executable size is
	  larger, since we are linking with liblwgeom. However, from both a
	  consistency and maintainability point of view, this is a big win.
	  Note that while there may be a difference in behaviour in some
	  corner cases, all regression tests pass here.

2008-10-31 10:41  mcayland

	* Add missing serialized_lwgeom_from_hexwkb() function to liblwgeom
	  which is required for adding liblwgeom support to pgsql2shp.

2008-10-31 10:04  mcayland

	* Some more shp2pgsql clearups; remove some dead commented code and
	  switch over to use the LWDEBUG(F) debugging framework.

2008-10-30 23:13  mcayland

	* Fix regression test differences between different platforms in
	  the AsGeoJSON regression code. There were two issues: firstly,
	  the original regression tests included precision information > 15
	  significant figures, and secondly the GeoJSON code was exposing
	  BOX2DFLOAT4 information to the client instead of calculating the
	  true bounding box. With thanks to Olivier Courtin.

2008-10-30 22:48  robe

	* Move over ST_DumpRings

2008-10-30 17:10  mcayland

	* Switch shp2pgsql over to use liblwgeom instead of its own
	  internal parser. Some notes from looking at the code:
	  
	  i) I've abstracted the I/O formatting functions into a new
	  OutputGeometry() function since it allow the logic concerning
	  output formatting to kept in one place, rather than sprinkled
	  throughout all the other Insert* functions.
	  
	  ii) InsertPoint() and InsertMultiPoint() have been combined,
	  since it seems that the same code will work for both - all that
	  is required is to know whether to produce a MULTIPOINT collecton
	  or a POINT at the end.
	  
	  iii) I've added additional comments within the Insert* functions
	  to help clarify what is going on in places
	  
	  iv) It appears some corner cases were missing within the
	  conversion code with respect to Z/M coordinates, so in theory the
	  new code should do a better job.
	  
	  All in all, the source code is slightly reduced in size (although
	  of course the binary is larger after linking with liblwgeom), and
	  seems a lot more readable to my eyes. A quick TODO is to go
	  through the file and replace the #if...#endif sections related to
	  debugging with LWDEBUG(F) options.
	  
	  NOTE: I've had to change the Makefile to allow linking against
	  the maths library and liblwgeom.a, so some manual intervention on
	  the automated build may be required ;)

2008-10-29 18:32  robe

	* Make more pretty section names, move over ST_Accum and provide
	  example.

2008-10-29 18:05  robe

2008-10-26 22:26  robe

	* Fix typo

2008-10-26 22:18  robe

	* Move over ST_Length* functions. Correct documentation - e.g.
	  missing ST_Length2D_Spheroid and ST_Length3d_Spheroid and
	  ST_Length_Spheroid are synonyms. Seems to disagree with how we
	  define ST_Length.

2008-10-26 21:24  robe

	  ST_Contains example to show distinction between ST_Covers,
	  ST_Contains etc.

2008-10-19 23:31  robe

	* typo in ST_Y definition. Also added common use-case example of
	  ST_Centroid used with ST_X, ST_Y

2008-10-19 14:52  mcayland

	* After several discussions at PGDay, it seems that the only
	  use-case for the PGXS PROGRAM clause is for programs that wish to
	  link with the backend libraries. Hence create a new Makefile for
	  the loader directory which uses the new autoconf infrastructure,
	  based upon library and dependency lists from the original 1.3
	  branch.

2008-10-19 14:40  robe

	* Move over remainder of Geometry Accessors to new section. Fix
	  ST_MemUnion (really ST_MemGeomUnion), correct mistake in
	  ST_SymDifference

2008-10-18 08:33  mcayland

2008-10-16 08:33  mcayland

	* Update to previous parser patch: if the error location is 0 (i.e.
	  we haven't even matched a valid OGC WKT type) then display a more
	  appropriate message. Per minor gripe from Paul.

2008-10-16 07:22  robe

	* update st_azimuth - it should be called vector instead of line
	  since order of points reverses the angle

	  from PostgreSQL, and update regression tests accordingly.

2008-10-15 13:43  robe

	* fix spacing of st_linemerge, st_segmentize examples.

2008-10-15 13:39  robe

	* Move over ST_Segmentize and ST_LineMerge

2008-10-14 23:08  kneufeld

	* moved cleanup of the pdf to the maintainer-clean target

2008-10-14 20:11  pramsey

	* Remove sliced test code and return to original state.

2008-10-14 19:51  mcayland

	* Nearly finish work on the new parser API. The key part of this
	  patch is to alter the behaviour of the parser so that instead of
	  generating errors directly, it returns an error code, error
	  location and an error message. Hence the caller is now in charge
	  of the behaviour when parsing invalid geometries, and so can
	  ignore errors or proceed onto the next geometry if required. The
	  regression test change is due to a change in an error message,
	  since the error is now returned from the unparser before it even
	  gets to GEOS.

2008-10-14 19:39  robe

	* Provide examples for ST_Simplify and ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology

2008-10-14 18:16  robe

	* Move over st_simplify and st_simplifypreservetopology. Still need
	  to put in examples.

2008-10-14 17:42  pramsey

	* astyle style=ansi indent=tab=8

2008-10-14 11:40  robe

	* completely move over rest of management functions to new section.
	  Add probe_geometry_columns - never been documented, but useful.
	  Get rid of update_geometry_stats - just returns a dumb message
	  that its obsolete.

2008-10-14 03:56  robe

	* Add missing function proto for dropgeometrytable

2008-10-13 13:16  mcayland

	* Rename parser_check_flags to current_parser_check_flags and
	  unparser_check_flags to current_unparser_check_flags to clarify
	  that these status variables only reflect the checks enabled for
	  the current parse.

2008-10-13 13:03  mcayland

	* Move the liblwgeom unparser example over to the dynptarray API
	  which is the proper way to alter point arrays in memory.

2008-10-13 11:36  mcayland

	* Fix up some more warnings in SVN trunk; note that there are still
	  2 remaining PreparedGeometry warnings, but these will require
	  patching GEOS.

2008-10-12 17:47  pramsey

	* Performance boost: only detoast the front of the tuple first and
	  extract the bbox from that.

2008-10-10 16:34  pramsey

	* Pull prep_cache reference safely inside PREPARED_GEOM #ifdef

2008-10-10 05:24  pramsey

	* Set keywords propery.

2008-10-10 05:17  pramsey

2008-10-10 04:41  pramsey

	* Rename lwgeom_geos_c.c to lwgeom_geos.c

2008-10-10 04:39  pramsey

	* Prepared geometries getting closer to readiness. Integrated into
	  standard functions, regression tests added.

2008-10-10 01:35  mleslie

	* Updating the regression test README file with details about the c
	  preprocessing step and the formatting of the _expected file
	  results.

2008-10-08 18:57  robe

	* SQL my MM

2008-10-08 18:51  robe

	* update st_translate include support for 3d flag

2008-10-08 18:27  pramsey

	* Move to memcmp keys, leave prepared functions tied to old keyed
	  signatures for now.

2008-10-08 10:14  mleslie

	* Rebuilt the box3d generation for circular strings to account for
	  a special large-arc case. Fix for issue 58, includes regression
	  test for the case.

2008-10-08 05:48  kneufeld

	* fixed several broken or redirected external URLs.

2008-10-08 05:45  kneufeld

2008-10-08 04:25  pramsey

	* Fix minor logic error in intersects() bbox shortcut.

2008-10-07 23:51  pramsey

	* Re-work prepared geom cache to use memcmp instead of keys, step
	  1.

2008-10-07 20:38  pramsey

	* Move DEBUG statement next to a req'd variable.

2008-10-07 18:09  robe

	* Fix boneheaded error in prepared intersects.

2008-10-04 17:49  pramsey

	* Protect prepared geometry implementation in GEOS>=3.1 defines.

2008-10-04 16:00  mcayland

	* Fix the DEBUGF statements I didn't realise I broke with the new
	  LWGEOM parser/unparser API (in response to Paul's r3061 commit).

2008-10-03 18:07  pramsey

	* Some extra debugf's in the prepared geometry code.

2008-10-03 17:37  pramsey

	* Patch up and comment out some DEBUGF lines that don't compile due
	  to changes in function
	  signatures in liblwgeom

2008-10-03 13:23  robe

	* correct incorrect statement

2008-10-03 13:20  robe

2008-10-03 09:22  robe

	* Add more examples of 3d use and annotate more 3d functions

2008-10-02 23:53  pramsey

	* Rework prepared geometry handling to look more like the
	  implementation of
	  PJ caching in transform.

2008-10-02 18:52  pramsey

	* Flip format to 'astyle --style=ansi --indent=tab=8' to make
	  upcoming
	  changes more consistent, stylewise. (Can't stand the mixed styles
	  anymore!)

2008-10-02 18:35  pramsey

	* add .so. to svn:ignore

2008-10-02 17:36  pramsey

	* add check for invalid srid to addgeometrycolumn (#33)

2008-10-02 16:46  pramsey

2008-10-02 16:15  robe

	* Flag more 3d compatible functions

2008-10-02 16:00  pramsey

	* pass commandline options into backend command (#45)

2008-10-02 15:56  pramsey

	* Fix log message to refer to correct function name

2008-10-02 12:43  robe

	* Fix minor typos in ST_Polygonize

2008-10-02 12:14  robe

	* Get rid of extra line breaks in specialty function section (by
	  changing xsl). Move over ST_Polygonize and provide examples.

2008-10-02 11:40  robe

	* Start annotating functions that support 3d, add some examples of
	  3d, update xsl to pull out functions that support 3d in a
	  separate special function index

2008-10-02 11:17  robe

	* extraneous junk left

2008-10-02 11:16  robe

	* Move over ST_Extent

2008-10-01 21:55  robe

	* Get rid of excess paragraph in mm compliance section

2008-10-01 21:53  robe

	* Moved some functions to Geometry Processing section

2008-10-01 21:42  robe

	* Put in SQL mm compliance for ST_Intersection

2008-10-01 20:04  robe

	* Move ST_Intersection to new reference_new.xml

2008-09-30 17:42  robe

	* Revise to include mm compliance section

2008-09-30 17:39  robe

	* Move over ST_Intersects sql mm compliance note to reference_new

2008-09-30 13:29  mcayland

	* Update regression tests to include test cases for GBT#21.

2008-09-30 13:25  mcayland

	* Fix for locate_along_measure returning invalid values (GBT#21)

2008-09-30 04:06  kneufeld

	* added a new aggregate and sql_mm toc to docs generated via a
	  custom xsl (provided by Regina Obe) to the documentation Makefile

2008-09-29 16:20  robe

	* change to sort functions alphabetically

2008-09-28 19:48  mcayland

	* Update LWGEOM unparser to (E)WKT/WKB to resturn a
	  LWGEOM_UNPARSER_RESULT structure instead of just the WKT/WKB
	  character array. This is the same work done for r3023 but applied
	  to the unparser instead.

2008-09-28 16:18  mcayland

	* With the advent of LWGEOM_PARSER_RESULT, it is now possible to
	  get rid of the horrible SERIALIZED_LWGEOM hack for PostgreSQL 8.3
	  to allow us to return the size separate from the result. This is
	  good as it removes another level of indirection from the parser.
	  Note that the size field has now been added to the
	  LWGEOM_PARSER_RESULT structure.

2008-09-28 15:47  mcayland

	* Clear up warnings (mixed declartions within code and invalid
	  return) from r3022.

2008-09-28 15:32  mcayland

	* Update (E)WKT/WKB parser to return a structure
	  (LWGEOM_PARSER_RESULT) instead of just the serialized lwgeom.
	  This is in preparation for returning more detailed error
	  information back to the caller.

2008-09-28 09:03  pramsey

	* Update pip shortcut code to be less aggressive in building cache.

2008-09-27 08:19  mcayland

	* Rename parser_check_flags to unparser_check_flags for the
	  unparser to prevent linking error under OS X. Also add missing
	  function prototype to silence compiler warning in the PiP code.

2008-09-26 21:46  pramsey

	* harmonize sql functions with c functions for prepared geometry

2008-09-26 21:34  pramsey

	* Make preparedgeometry memory handling a good deal kinder (no
	  longer losing base geometry every time)

2008-09-26 21:01  robe

	* put index in listitems and hope for the best

2008-09-26 19:43  pramsey

	* P-I-P rennovation complete: memory leaks gone, multipolygon
	  support added

2008-09-26 18:59  robe

	* correct the comments

2008-09-26 18:55  robe

	* xsl that generates index listing of postgis spatial aggregates
	  and MM compliant functions

2008-09-26 12:45  robe

	* Put in author/license info (hmm this is a guess - couldn't find a
	  good example in SVN to go by). Also comment on what xsl is doing.

2008-09-26 02:50  kneufeld

	* updated "make clean" directive to include the newly generated
	  PDFs

2008-09-25 21:50  mcayland

	* Add parser flags to the LWGEOM to (E)WKB/WKT parsers, similar to
	  has already been done for the (E)WKB/WKT to LWGEOM parsers.

2008-09-25 21:34  mcayland

	* Remove missing variables from LWDEBUG(F) statement that would
	  cause compilation to fail with POSTGIS_DEBUG_LEVEL > 0

2008-09-25 20:46  pramsey

	* Another biggish leak into the parent context.

2008-09-25 19:18  pramsey

	* More small memory leaks removed.

2008-09-25 17:18  pramsey

	* Remove more memory leaks from P-I-P shortcut code.

2008-09-25 12:18  robe

	* More typo fixes

2008-09-25 12:10  robe

	* Move over ST_MakePointM, miscellaneous typo fixes

2008-09-24 14:05  robe

	* Put svn back in microversion

2008-09-24 14:01  robe

	* typo

2008-09-24 13:55  robe

	* Added ST_MakePointM, removed redundant redefinition of MakePointM
	  so docs are now in synch with actual functions.

2008-09-23 21:32  mcayland

	* Use __va_copy() to pass a copy of the variadic structure to
	  lw_vasprintf() to solve ABI difference between 32bit/64bit
	  architectures.

2008-09-23 19:59  mcayland

	* Remove a couple more warnings when compiling with debug enabled
	  from lwgeom_gist.c.

2008-09-23 19:53  mcayland

	* Revert commit 2990: the real bug was that the LWDEBUG statement
	  was incorrect rather than the code - the additional read_int()
	  was causing an off-by-one error when outputting WKB causing
	  several regression tests to fail.

2008-09-23 19:44  mcayland

	* Refactor the memory management routines to account for the fact
	  that variadic functions can't be called directly from the initial
	  allocators. Also solve issues related to differences between the
	  system vasprintf() (if supplied) and the liblwgeom vasprintf() by
	  renaming to lw_vasprintf() and using it throughout PostGIS. With
	  all this in place, GBT#54 is fixed which is very useful when
	  debugging ;)

2008-09-23 19:07  pramsey

	* Reduce p-i-p memory leak by 50%

2008-09-23 13:05  robe

	* fix typo add more links

2008-09-23 13:00  robe

	* Move over ST_Buffer

2008-09-22 22:59  pramsey

	* Add cnt declaration where missing.

2008-09-22 17:55  robe

	* change to xsl 1.0 plus minor indent change

2008-09-22 12:28  robe

	* Add xsl file that autogenerates sql set comment statements from
	  reference_new.xml

2008-09-22 12:18  robe

	* Realized from my sql comment generation xsl that there is really
	  no ST_WKTToSQL that takes an SRID and no ST_BD.. that doesn't
	  take an SRID. Very shocking.

2008-09-21 23:15  robe

	* typo in st_setsrid returns geometry not boolean

2008-09-18 22:12  pramsey

	* Add a few more generated files to ignore

2008-09-18 22:09  pramsey

	* Set ignore properties on generated files.

2008-09-18 13:54  mcayland

	* Update the code for unparsing LWGEOMs to WKB/WKT so that it
	  includes the standard simple checks: LINESTRINGs must have > 2
	  points, POLYGONs must have closed rings and CIRCULARSTRINGs must
	  have > 2 points and the number of points must be odd. There is
	  still a little more work to do to allow flags to be passed into
	  the parser to specify which checks should be enforced, much like
	  has already been done for the parsing from WKB/WKT to LWGEOM.

2008-09-18 04:34  kneufeld

	* commit to test autobuild process and svn hooks
	  - removed extra tabs from preformatted text blocks

2008-09-18 04:22  kneufeld

	* commit to test autobuild process and svn hooks
	  - removed extra tabs from preformatted text blocks

2008-09-17 15:05  robe

	* Add to ST_SetSRID - reference to spatial_ref_sys

2008-09-17 14:46  robe

	* Link ST_SetSRID to updated spatial_ref_sys section using cutesy
	  anchor.

2008-09-17 14:41  robe

	* Give spatial reference systems section a cutesy anchor.

2008-09-17 05:49  robe

	* 

2008-09-17 05:48  robe

	* typo in link

2008-09-17 04:14  robe

	* more fleshing out of spatial ref section

2008-09-17 04:00  robe

	* Beef up spatial reference section. Still needs work.

2008-09-17 03:54  kneufeld

	* added an id to ST_Buffer to provide an end link for cross
	  references.

2008-09-16 22:43  mcayland

	* Silence a few more compiler warnings that had appeared during my
	  last few parser commits.

2008-09-16 22:29  mcayland

	* Add an example of how the liblwgeom API can be used by other C
	  programs to manipulate geometries and output the result.
	  Currently the unparser.c program shows how a geometry can be
	  constructed "on the fly" and then exported in both WKT and HEXWKB
	  formats; however it gives programmers the potential to devise
	  some very unique processing tools which can generate files that
	  can be loaded into PostGIS.

2008-09-16 18:44  mcayland

	* Move the LWGEOM-specific functions from lwgeom_sqlmm.c into
	  liblwgeom/lwsegmentize.c to ensure that liblwgeom can exist as a
	  standalone library.

2008-09-16 13:35  robe

	* Cleanup of FAQ

2008-09-16 13:17  robe

	* Move over ST_Expand

2008-09-16 01:51  robe

	* Expand list of contributors

	* Expand list of contributors

2008-09-15 11:54  robe

	* Fix url link to proj to point to osgeo

2008-09-13 05:41  kneufeld

	  Fixed link errors to ST_IsSimple.

2008-09-12 12:12  robe

	* typo

2008-09-12 10:46  robe

	* Spelled Kevin's last name wrong and Mateusz first name wrong.
	  Sorry Kevin and Mateusz.

2008-09-12 10:40  robe

	* Update Credits and project links
	  1) Get rid of emails
	  2) Change order of key contributors based on heuristics a)
	  duration of contribution, b) frequency of contributions,
	  c)recency of contributions, d) impact of contributions,
	  and add some new contributors (more need to be added)

2008-09-11 12:18  mcayland

	* Reinstate the PDF documentation system based on OpenJade,
	  including integration with autoconf. "make postgis.pdf" should
	  now output lovely PDF format documentation :)

2008-09-11 12:04  mcayland

	* Documentation fixes to allow PDF documents to be generated from
	  Docbook source using OpenJade - OpenJade seems a lot more strict
	  than xsltproc when generating output :(

2008-09-10 21:06  robe

	* Get rid of left over stuff from ST_IsValid and ST_Summary copy.

2008-09-10 11:57  robe

	* example and result misaligned

2008-09-10 11:39  robe

	* Add ST_IsValid reference to ST_Within.

2008-09-09 21:10  mcayland

	* Allow a flags parameter to be passed into the WKT parser to
	  determine which consistency checks are performed out of polygon
	  ring closure, minimum number of points and odd number of points.

2008-09-08 20:17  mcayland

	* Commit generated versions of the new parser files for people who
	  do not have flex or bison installed.

2008-09-08 20:16  mcayland

	* Enhance geometry parser so that it keeps track of the current
	  position during parsing. With a bit more work, this should allow
	  error messages to pinpoint the exact location of an invalid
	  geometry section or syntax error.

2008-09-08 13:12  robe

	* Move over ST_Translate and provide example use

2008-09-07 11:02  mcayland

	* Yet another update to the liblwgeom parser API -
	  lwgeom_from_ewkt() has been renamed to
	  serialized_lwgeom_from_ewkt() to indicate that the function
	  returns a serialied LWGEOM rather than an unserialized LWGEOM
	  structure.

2008-09-07 09:14  robe

	* typo in funcprototype

2008-09-07 09:07  robe

	  changes to ST_Within

2008-09-04 18:28  robe

	* Put in disclaimer on ST_Equals when dealing with invalid
	  geometries

2008-09-04 12:40  robe

2008-09-04 12:04  robe

	* accidentally took out reference from ST_OrderingEquals

2008-09-04 11:56  robe

	* Move over ST_Overlaps to new reference section and provide some
	  examples

2008-08-28 21:09  robe

	* Fixed url links to geos and proj. Both are now osgeo projects and
	  no longer at refractions or remotesensing. Move around
	  instructions putting geos and proj compilation steps at the end
	  per Mark's request

2008-08-27 04:34  kneufeld

	* moved ST_IsClosed to the new documentation template.

2008-08-24 04:54  kneufeld

	* moved ST_StartPoint and ST_EndPoint to new reference_new.xml

2008-08-22 17:47  robe

	* another typo

2008-08-22 17:36  robe

	* More typos

2008-08-22 13:37  robe

	* typo

2008-08-22 13:05  robe

	* More reordering

2008-08-22 12:52  robe

	* Installation got moved out of order for some reason.

2008-08-22 12:32  robe

	* Typo

2008-08-22 12:14  robe

	* Updated the installations docs. I took some of Olivier Courtin
	  instructions for install
	  (http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-August/020746.html)
	  which seemed much easier to follow than the ones we currently
	  have. Also corrected path settings we had to the install files.
	  They are all in downloads not root of postgis as we suggested.

2008-08-21 11:27  mcayland

	* Update PostGIS README file to account for changes in SVN trunk.

2008-08-21 10:56  mcayland

	* Update PostGIS SVN trunk to use the new 8.4 GiST API (where
	  RECHECK is now specified within the consistent function, rather
	  than being supplied as part of the operator class definition).
	  This allows PostGIS to compile and pass regression tests on the
	  latest PostgreSQL 8.4 CVS HEAD.

2008-08-21 08:45  mcayland

	* Alter the lwgeom Makefile so that liblwgeom.a is linked directly,
	  rather than using the -L...-l options on the command line. This
	  is to prevent problems on OSX where PGXSadds the PostgreSQL
	  $libdir to the PostGIS link line, causing it to link to
	  liblwgeom.so produced by older versions of PostGIS rather than
	  the static liblwgeom.a.
	  
	  Also change the PGXS CPP/LIB equivalent variables to use += so
	  that extra compile/link options can be supplied. Per report from
	  Robert Rainthorpe, with thanks to William Kyngesburye.

2008-08-12 16:42  pramsey

	* move to CLASS/STYLE mapserver 5.X syntax

2008-08-04 11:50  robe

	* Moved over ST_SRID, fixed a typo, added some references

2008-08-04 11:32  robe

	* got rid of additional entry for ST_GeomFromText - was already
	  moved over, moved over ST_PointFromText, ST_MakePoint

2008-08-03 15:05  pramsey

	* Spelling changes from Mark Kolybabi.

2008-08-02 22:03  mcayland

	* Add a download reference for Apache Ant, plus fix a couple more
	  typos.

2008-08-02 08:41  mcayland

	* Correct typo from the previous documentation commit.

2008-08-02 08:24  mcayland

	* A long overdue documentation update - update the installation
	  section to reflect the many changes in the new SVN trunk build
	  system.

2008-08-01 16:01  robe

	* bad break in GeoJSON example

2008-08-01 15:18  robe

	* Provide example for geojson (excerpts from postgis newsgroup
	  thread)

2008-08-01 15:12  kneufeld

	* Reverted html markup for mathematical expressions in ST_Touches
	  and ST_Crosses to a gif image. It seems unicode markup does not
	  work well for both IE and Firefox. The next best thing to do is
	  to get MathML markup working.

2008-08-01 04:42  kneufeld

	* small grammar correction in ST_Touches

2008-08-01 04:26  kneufeld

	* added ST_Touches examples

2008-07-31 12:32  robe

	* took out kml example - causing parsing error.

2008-07-31 12:14  robe

	* Moved over remaining geometry output functions and put in
	  availability for each.

2008-07-31 06:35  robe

	* Put in Availability 1.3.4 for ST_AsGeoJSON

2008-07-31 06:33  kneufeld

	* fixed small typo in ST_Touches mathematical expression

2008-07-31 06:29  kneufeld

	* Moved over ST_Touches to new PostGIS reference. Examples
	  forthcoming.

2008-07-31 04:57  kneufeld

	* replaced the mathematical gif expression in ST_Crosses with
	  simple html markup

2008-07-30 14:05  robe

	* Move over ST_WKTToSQL and also defined ST_GeometryFromText
	  (didn't see it in the old docs, but its not deprecated and is a
	  popular variant)

2008-07-30 11:41  robe

	* Got rid pf superfluous redirection to deprecated functions of
	  ST_GeomFromWkb and ST_GeomFromText - now they just point directly
	  to the c functions. Changed all FromWKB, FromText variants to
	  point to the non-deprecated ST_GeomFrom, ST_BuildArea etc.
	  (before they were pointing at deprecated functions)

2008-07-29 15:46  robe

	* grammatical error

2008-07-29 15:42  robe

	* Move over ST_Collect and ST_Union, provide examples for ST_Union.
	  Get rid of comment about don't use ST_Union with geometry
	  collections - seems to work fine with those.

2008-07-29 12:35  robe

	* typo in function declare for perimeter

2008-07-29 12:00  robe

	* remove ST_Area from reference.xml already accounted for in
	  reference_new.xml, move over ST_Length, ST_Perimeter

2008-07-29 05:43  kneufeld

	* moved over st_pointonsurface and provided examples.

2008-07-29 05:11  kneufeld

	* moved over st_centroid and provided examples in both svg and png
	  format. Eventually, ImageMagick will be used to generate the png
	  files, but for now they are committed into svn.

2008-07-29 04:42  robe

	* minor formatting changes, note about ST_NumPOints being an alias
	  for ST_NPoints moving forward.

2008-07-28 19:05  kneufeld

	* fixed some minor xrefences in the documentation so the autobuild
	  doesn't throw errors.

2008-07-28 12:07  robe

	* Move over ST_GeomFromEWKT, ST_GeomFromEWKB and provide examples.
	  Fix some miscellaneous references.

2008-07-28 10:03  mcayland

	* Allow Makefile substitutions for PGCONFIG which are required if
	  pg_config is not located in the path. Note that as part of this
	  fix, we now need to generate topology/Makefile using autoconf.
	  Thanks to Jorgen Austvik for the report and partial patch.

2008-07-28 09:13  mcayland

	* Fix -o option for flex; the output filename must be specified
	  immediately after -o without any preceding white space. Per
	  report from Jorgen Austvik.

2008-07-24 11:58  robe

	* Move over ST_GeomFromText and provide examples

2008-07-24 10:22  mcayland

	* Add PROJ.4 version check to ensure that a minimum version of
	  4.5.0 is installed. This is to ensure that the
	  pj_set_searchpath() function is present (note: it was actually
	  added in 4.4.9, however we version detect on major.minor rather
	  than major.minor.release)

2008-07-24 05:55  kneufeld

	* Moved several version functions to the new PostGIS reference.

2008-07-23 17:13  kneufeld

	* added some xreferences so the autobuild process does not throw
	  errors.

2008-07-23 16:40  kneufeld

	* changed @@LAST_RELEASE_VERSION@@ with a DocBook variable so the
	  correct version number gets substituted in all included files,
	  not just postgis.xml

2008-07-23 12:03  robe

	* move of ST_AsBinary,ST_AsEWKB - add examples, various minor fixes
	  to ST_As function descriptions

2008-07-23 10:56  robe

	* 

2008-07-22 13:53  robe

	* Deprecate ST_area2d

2008-07-22 11:38  robe

	* Move over ST_AsText, ST_AsEWKT and provide examples. Change order
	  of ST_Multi.

2008-07-22 11:12  robe

	* move over ST_SetSRID, ST_Transform and ST_Multi. Provide
	  examples.

2008-07-21 16:20  robe

	* Remove ST_Area2D and replace with ST_Area - move to new section
	  and provide example

2008-07-21 12:09  robe

	* Move over ST_GeometryType, ST_MakePolygon

2008-07-21 11:38  robe

	* delete reference to ST_Equals in reference.xml - alread in new
	  version, include an ST_DWithin non-join join example.

2008-07-18 12:23  robe

	* Move over ST_AddPoint, ST_RemovePoint, ST_Npoints, ST_NumPoints
	  and provide examples.

2008-07-17 14:16  robe

	* Move ST_Reverse and add example

2008-07-17 12:14  robe

	* Move ST_BuildArea expand on definition, provide example, Move
	  ST_BdPolyFromText and ST_BdMPolyFromText

2008-07-17 11:20  robe

	* move over ST_Within and provide example

2008-07-16 08:42  mcayland

	* Fix for segfault in ANALYZE due to incorrect use of legacy BOX
	  type within compute_geometry_stats() (Fixes GBT#43). Thanks to
	  Landon Fuller for the bug report and fix.

2008-07-16 06:42  kneufeld

	* moved ST_Envelope, complete with examples.

2008-07-16 05:10  kneufeld

	* updated the st_crosses method:
	  made the geometry parameters lowercase and made a few changes to
	  content.

2008-07-16 05:03  kneufeld

	* Moved ST_Crosses into new reference_new.xml file, complete with
	  images.
	  Updated css to use fixed-width fonts for programlistings.

2008-07-16 04:55  kneufeld

	* fixed small typo

2008-07-16 04:54  kneufeld

	* Apparently, the <inlinegraphic> will become deprecated in a
	  future version of DocBook. Now replaced with <inlinemediaobject>.

2008-07-15 21:20  kneufeld

	* fixed a small typo so the autobuild process will still work.

2008-07-15 19:38  robe

	* Move ST_Equals, ST_OrderingEquals - provide examples. Make
	  Geometry - geometry

2008-07-15 18:02  robe

	* minor corrections to ST_SetSRID and UpdateGeometrySRID

2008-07-15 17:54  robe

	* remove includes index note for ST_MakeLine

2008-07-15 17:51  robe

	* Move ST_Intersection, ST_Disjoint provide examples for both.

2008-07-15 15:33  kneufeld

	* applied patch from Mark to fix the if/then/else so the Makefile
	  can run on older systems (ie. FC3)

2008-07-15 11:34  robe

	* typo

2008-07-15 11:03  robe

	* Move ST_MakeLine from reference.xml to reference_new.xml and add
	  an additional example to ST_MakeLine

2008-07-15 06:57  kneufeld

	* Started migration of the functions in reference.xml using the
	  <variablelist> concept to a new "reference_new.xml" using
	  DocBook's <refentry> concept. Once migration is complete,
	  reference.xml will be removed and reference_new.xml will be
	  renamed to reference.xml. The included template.xml file is not
	  used, except to provide example usage of DocBook's refentry tag.

2008-07-14 21:52  pramsey

	* Updated CSS from Dane Springmeyer

2008-07-14 16:30  robe

	* Example use case of ST_DWithin

2008-07-14 11:40  mcayland

	* Modify autoconf stylesheet logic (again) to correctly distinguish
	  between the case where a valid docbook stylesheet is found
	  automatically and where it is explicitly specified using the
	  --with-xsldir option.

2008-07-14 10:41  mcayland

	* Change autoconf iconv-detection code so that ICONV_LDFLAGS is
	  explicitly set in the AC_CHECK_LIB() action-if-found section
	  (LIBS does not get automatically set when action-if-found is
	  set). Thanks to Olivier Courtin for the bug report.

2008-07-14 10:05  mcayland

	* Apply some autoconf / Makefile changes from Olivier Courtin.
	  XSLBASE should not be checked for validity unless it has been
	  explicitly specified using the --with-xsldir option, and we also
	  add some friendlier messages in the documentation Makefile in
	  case the DocBook stylesheets and/or xsltproc cannot be found.
	  Additionally, the configure --help output has been tidied up
	  using the AS_HELP_STRING macro.

2008-07-13 23:47  pramsey

	* Apply GeoJSON patch from Olivier Courtin.

2008-07-13 17:33  mcayland

	* Rename the new parser function ewkt_to_lwgeom() to
	  lwgeon_from_ewkt() so that it matches the rest of the parser API

2008-07-13 11:09  mcayland

	* Add some additional LWDEBUG(F) statements for debugging that I
	  missed the first time around with the new debugging
	  infrastructure

2008-07-13 10:50  mcayland

	* More work on improving the EWKT/B parser; remove all references
	  to allocator functions from outside of liblwgeom by generating
	  wrapper functions with more meaningful names. As well as cleaning
	  up the API, it also makes the code much more readable

2008-07-11 10:48  robe

	* Example uses of ST_Line_SubString

2008-07-10 13:16  robe

	* Examples of using ST_ExteriorRing and ST_NumInteriorRings

2008-07-09 11:16  robe

	* Numerous small changes. Changed some returns 1 (TRUE) to just
	  TRUE. Automatic casting between 0 1 and boolean no longer exists
	  in PostgreSQL. Lets not confuse people by suggesting to them they
	  are the same.

2008-07-08 13:30  robe

	* numerous changes(remove additional parent, argument list changes,
	  multi function breakout)

2008-07-08 12:01  robe

	* Provide examples of using ST_MakePolygon in conjunction with
	  ST_Accum and PostgreSQL ARRAY() function

2008-07-08 06:05  mleslie

	* Added brief descriptions to the SQL-MM curve types.

2008-07-08 05:15  kneufeld

	* modified toc top generation level param

2008-07-08 05:09  kneufeld

	* split postgis.xml into manageable chunks, broken at chapter
	  divisions.

2008-07-08 03:12  kneufeld

	* updated tips section to reference ST_* function names

2008-07-07 12:20  robe

	* Example of ST_AddPoint, some fixes of non-ST references,
	  miscellaneous indenting changes.

2008-07-07 11:57  robe

	* Add examples for ST_MakePolygon, correct non-st to ST references
	  in ST_MakePolygon section

2008-07-06 07:22  robe

	* fixed ST_Dimension example, flipped order of conditions in WHERE
	  on some examples (in later versions of PostgreSQL since we don't
	  have our costs right - the planner may choose to process in order
	  of conditions

2008-07-06 01:47  kneufeld

	* fixed typo in a WKT example.

2008-07-03 19:07  robe

	* Examples of use of ST_MakeLine, correction to my ST_Collect
	  example.

2008-07-03 17:36  pramsey

	* Add version information to <title>

2008-07-03 17:08  pramsey

	* Match version numbers to new naming conventions.

2008-07-03 09:28  mcayland

	* Add the parser build rules back into the liblwgeom Makefile, so
	  now any changes to either the lexer or parser source files will
	  automatically invoke a rebuild of the relevant output files
	  during make

2008-07-01 14:15  mcayland

	* Fix liblwgeom requiring gcc to compile. By using macros and
	  variables supplied by libtool, we can now detect the PIC flags
	  and whether the compiler will accept additional gcc warning flags
	  for developers

2008-06-30 15:30  robe

	* Fixed typo

2008-06-29 19:19  mcayland

	* Move some PostgreSQL compatibility macros from lwgeom_pg.h into
	  pgsql_compat.h which is their proper home

2008-06-29 19:11  mcayland

	* Split the basic geometry accessors into a separate static library
	  liblwgeom.a; this potentially allows re-use of the liblwgeom
	  functions from within PostGIS, or could be extended at a later
	  date to include databases other than MySQL. This patch includes a
	  change to the liblwgeom handler functions; instead of sprinkling
	  init_pg_func()s around the source, I have changed the default
	  liblwgeom handlers to make use of a callback to allow linked
	  libraries to set their own handlers the first time any of them
	  are called. I have also tidied up the parser API a little in
	  liblwgeom.h, which means wktparse.h can be removed from all of
	  the headers in the lwgeom/ directory, plus renamed wktunparse.c
	  to lwgunparse.c to keep things similar to lwgparse.c. Finally, I
	  renamed liblwgeom.c to lwutil.c to avoid confusion within the new
	  interface. TODO: the liblwgeom Makefile has some gcc-specific
	  options, but these can be fixed later - it seemed more important
	  to make the warnings visible to developers.

2008-06-28 05:34  robe

	* Flesh out definition of ST_Collect and how to use it.

2008-06-26 02:40  kneufeld

	* ST_SnapToGrid SQL functions were referencing the deprecated
	  SnapToGrid instead of their ST_.. equivalents.

2008-06-24 16:12  robe

	* Fix mismatched para in intersection documentation and remove
	  dangling command tag in Reporting Documentation Issues section.

2008-06-24 15:57  robe

	* Definitions for st_convexhull and st_shift_longitude

2008-06-06 08:53  mcayland

	* Rearrange lwgeom/Makefile.in in terms of the liblwgeom/PostgreSQL
	  distinction, plus remove remaining JTS reference.

2008-06-06 08:48  mcayland

	* Remove JTS support from liblwpostgis; native GCJ-compiled JTS
	  code is reported not to be reliable enough within a production
	  environment, so well stick with GEOS.

2008-06-05 16:08  mcayland

	* Some more updates to lwpostgis.sql.in.c; correct a couple of
	  missing conversions from OPAQUE_TYPE to internal (how on earth
	  did regression tests pass with this still in place??), plus
	  remove the UPDATE on pg_opclass to change the OID of the index
	  storage type since we can do this by specifying a STORAGE clause
	  instead.

2008-06-05 14:49  mcayland

	* Remove Makefile from lwgeom/ directory; it is no longer needed as
	  it is automatically generated from lwgeom/Makefile.in

2008-06-05 14:47  mcayland

	* Update new Makefile copyrights, also remove compat.h from the
	  loader/ directory since it is now no longer needed.

2008-06-05 14:30  mcayland

	* Update copyrights for configure.ac (rewritten from scratch, and
	  now renamed from the deprecated form configure.in) and also the
	  PROJ.4 version detection macro

2008-06-05 12:09  mcayland

	* Switch all SQL and PL/PGSQL stored procedures over to use dollar
	  quoting instead of apostrophes for function bodies. At last, most
	  of the stored procedures actually become readable

2008-06-05 11:19  mcayland

	* Remove the HAS_SCHEMA #define and all related #else code since we
	  now guarantee to be using PostgreSQL > 7.2

2008-06-05 11:07  mcayland

	* Remove PQunescapeBytea hack from pgsql2shp which is no longer
	  needed, as it was only required for versions of PostgreSQL < 7.3

2008-06-05 10:51  mcayland

	* Remove all of the pre-PostgreSQL 7.3 schema #ifdefs from
	  lwpostgis.sql.in to make things readable once again.

2008-06-05 10:19  mcayland

	* Blast away the huge amounts of legacy C code related to
	  PostgreSQL versions < 8.1. Next step will be to work on the SQL
	  script files too.

2008-05-31 10:35  mcayland

	* Provide a new text file called DEBUG explaining how to use the
	  new debug system.

2008-05-31 09:56  mcayland

	* Commit new PostGIS debugging infrastructure. These changes unify
	  all the debug logging to use a new set of macros:
	  LWDEBUG()/LWDEBUGF() for LWGEOM functions, and
	  POSTGIS_DEBUG()/POSTGIS_DEBUGF() for PostgreSQL functions. To
	  enable debugging, run configure with --enable-debug and then
	  remake the entire project. If --enable-debug is omitted during
	  configure, the above macros evaluate to (void)0, and hence should
	  be removed by the compiler during optimisation. Also: contains
	  minor warning cleanups and a fix for the ST_Dwithin SQL
	  definition.

2008-05-28 23:03  pramsey

	* Enhanced speed _ST_DWithin(g,g,d) that returns as soon as g and g
	  are within d of each other, rather than using distance naively.
	  Change ST_DWithin to use enhanced op. (Issue 20)

2008-05-28 21:58  pramsey

	* Fix towgs84 for 31300 and 31370 (issue 23)

2008-05-28 21:47  pramsey

	* Geomunion name change note, issue 26.

2008-05-28 21:45  pramsey

	* Bug reporting documentation (issue 27)

2008-05-28 21:35  pramsey

	* Fix for issue 30, ST_Buffer doco mistake

2008-05-27 15:08  mcayland

	* Remove extra warnings related to the shp2pgsql deleted records
	  patch

2008-05-27 14:47  mcayland

	* Update new build system to include iconv detection for shp2pgsql

2008-05-27 03:00  pramsey

	* Fix for DBF files with deleted records. (#29)

2008-05-22 20:43  mcayland

	* Since PGXS compiles libraries with -Wall, attempt to remove as
	  many warnings as possible. Most of these are missing function
	  prototypes at the top of each file.

2008-05-22 14:34  mcayland

	* Update documentation build so that "make install" now works.
	  Maybe this will fix the on-line website build?

2008-05-22 14:31  mcayland

	* Update topology/ directory to use the new PGXS build system.

2008-05-20 22:24  mcayland

	* Update previous commit: add Makefile.in and remove Makefile,
	  since Makefile is now generated from Makefile.in automatically.

2008-05-20 22:10  mcayland

	* Rework the documentation Makefile so that it works with the
	  autoconf build system.

2008-05-14 17:24  mcayland

	* Fixes for previous commit: missed Makefile.config target for
	  "make clean"

2008-05-14 17:19  mcayland

	* Fixes for previous commit: Alter GNUmakefile to understand that
	  Makefile.config no longer exists, plus remove lwgeom/sqldefines.h
	  as it is generated by autoconf

2008-05-14 17:10  mcayland

	* Commit new build system based upon PGXS. Due to the large number
	  of changes, please refer to
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-May/003010.html.

2008-04-24 01:04  pramsey

	* ST_AsGeoJSon patch from Olivier Courtin
	  <olivier.courtin@camptocamp.com>.

2008-04-22 14:54  pramsey

	* envelope doco fix

2008-04-12 18:39  pramsey

	* Bump trunk up to 1.3.4SVN

2008-04-12 18:32  pramsey

	* Versions and news for the 1.3.3 release.

2008-04-12 16:46  pramsey

	* Update re dbf patch

2008-04-12 16:44  pramsey

	* New -n switch to support DBF-only loading of attributes without
	  shapes.
	  Submitted by Regina Obe.

2008-04-12 10:16  mcayland

	* Remove svn:eol-style from regress_ogc_expected; MingW requires
	  unix line endings in order for the diff to work as expected.

2008-04-10 14:44  pramsey

	* Reduce FTDate field size to 8 bytes from 10. Matches other calls
	  in the file
	  now, no good explanation in code why it was 10 to start with.
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-April/019169.html

2008-04-10 06:40  mcayland

	* Another round of PostgreSQL 8.3 fixes, this time related to
	  arrays. Make sure that we use the supplied ArrayType pointer
	  macros, instead of attempting to access to cast directly to
	  ArrayType. This resolved GBT#13 where a "corrupted histogram"
	  error is thrown when using using ST_EstimatedExtent() under 8.3.

2008-04-09 19:52  pramsey

	* Change sr_id into an integer, per mca's suggestion.

2008-04-08 21:36  pramsey

	* Fix string literal comparison warnings: "comparison with string
	  literal results in
	  unspecified behaviour"

2008-04-07 20:09  pramsey

	* Rename all occurances of getopt to pgis_getopt to work around
	  OS/X 10.5 system function name collision.

2008-04-07 19:47  pramsey

	* Fix the ST_AsKML regression tests.

2008-04-07 19:47  pramsey

	* Allow conditional regression tests based on GEOS_VERNUM and move
	  the
	  cover/prepared tests into the appropriate buckets. Fix the
	  AT_AsKML
	  regression tests.

2008-04-05 14:49  pramsey

	* remove unloved header file

2008-03-31 11:16  mcayland

	* Remove the code that adds share/contrib/nad to the PROJ.4 search
	  path for PostgreSQL < 8.0 since the mechanism for determining the
	  path has changed from earlier versions, and this was mainly for
	  Win32 users. Also rename nad/ directory to proj/ to keep it
	  inline with an existing PROJ.4 installation.

2008-03-30 19:38  pramsey

	* small syntax errors in ST_YMAX, etc functions

2008-03-30 19:37  pramsey

	* confirm st_*min st_*max

2008-03-28 23:24  pramsey

	* Syntax error in sql.in

2008-03-28 21:31  pramsey

	* Fixed up KML patch from Eduin Carillo.

2008-03-28 21:28  pramsey

	* Enable the USE_PROJ and GEOS_VERNUM macros to propogate into
	  lwpostgis.sql.in

2008-03-28 21:10  pramsey

	* Revert KML patch, bad puppy!

2008-03-28 21:04  pramsey

	* Added KML patch from Eduin Carillo.
	  http://code.google.com/p/postgis/issues/detail?id=17

2008-03-28 20:18  pramsey

	* Changed ifeq to ifndef for CXX macro test.

2008-03-28 20:17  pramsey

	* Removed unloved and un-used geos_version.sh file.

2008-03-28 20:03  pramsey

	* Added SVN support patch from Dr. Marco Hugentobler, as described
	  in
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-February/002883.html

2008-03-28 19:25  pramsey

	* Added GEOS_VERNUM macro and protected GEOS 3.0/3.1 functionality
	  behind it.

2008-03-28 18:55  mcayland

	* Fix crash caused by double-free in LWGEOM_same - we were
	  accidentally freeing the 1st parameter twice instead of freeing
	  the second parameter. Thanks to Cliff Wright for the bug report.

2008-03-28 17:05  pramsey

	* Removed regress_ogc_prep from tests temporarily until a new GEOS
	  is released with support
	  for new predicates.

2008-03-27 21:18  mcayland

	* Fix bug with |>> and <<| operators - the BOX2D overabove and
	  overbelow functions were actually wrong, causing index scans to
	  return the wrong results. Per bug report from Tomas Karlsson.

2008-03-26 03:40  pramsey

	* Change link to postgis bug tracker

2008-03-21 08:17  mcayland

	* Resolve GBT bugs #2,#3 and #9 related to crashes when calling
	  aggregate functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 (all earlier versions
	  would not see the error). This was due to missing more VARSIZE
	  macros in the PostgreSQL 8.3 conversion. The complete list of
	  affected functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 is: ST_force_2d(),
	  ST_force_3dz(), ST_force_3dm(), ST_force_4d(), ST_Collect(),
	  ST_MakeLine(), ST_Polygonize(), ST_Union()/ST_GeomUnion(),
	  ST_MakePolygon()/ST_Polygon().

2008-02-12 15:05  pramsey

	* Document ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(geometry,float)

2008-02-12 15:03  pramsey

	* Added hook to GEOSTopologyPreserveSimplify

2008-01-29 01:24  benjubb

	* Changed the interface for the GEOS prepared predicates.
	  ST_contains, ST_containsProperly, ST_covers, and ST_intersects
	  are now overloaded.
	  The new arguments style is ( geometry, geometry, integer). The
	  third argument is used to determine when the first argument
	  changes. The assumption is that when the third argument changes,
	  the first argument is assumed to have changed too. This
	  side-steps the issue of determining when the identity of the
	  first geometry changes.

2008-01-22 19:44  benjubb

	* Ammended to include prepared geometry cache code in scope of
	  PREPARED_GEOM symbol.

2008-01-22 00:24  benjubb

	* Modified to check version of GEOS and stub out prepared
	  predicates if GEOS is prior to 3.1.0

2008-01-18 18:57  benjubb

	* Made some minor changes suggested by Mark Cave-Ayland.

2008-01-18 01:05  benjubb

	* Added new function wrappers to expose prepared geometry
	  predicates:
	  ST_ContainsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_ContainsProperlyPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_CoversPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_IntersectsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  
	  as well, this function was added, for orthogonality:
	  ST_ContainsProperly( geometry, geometry )

2008-01-18 01:04  benjubb

	* Added new functions to lwgeom_geos_c.c to support prepared
	  geometry predicates.
	  bool containsPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool containsProperlyPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool coversPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool intersectsPrepared( geom, geom)

2008-01-18 00:59  benjubb

	* Tests for the prepared geometry predicates.
	  The tests were copied from regress_ogc, and modified.
	  Most of the tests use a pattern where the same function is
	  invoked three times with the same argument.
	  This tests the prepared geometry caching mechanism.
	  This testfile haven't been added to regress/Makefile yet, as it
	  fails for one case. This
	  probably due to a bug in GEOS.

2008-01-11 15:05  mcayland

	* Bump version number to 1.3.3SVN for next development cycle.

2008-01-11 15:04  mcayland

	* Rewrite the pgsql2shp connection string code so that it uses a
	  connection string, rather than setting environment variables.
	  MingW-compiled and MSVC-compiled apps seem to have great problems
	  passing the variables to each other, causing regression to fail.
	  With this fix (and a Makefile tweak), it is now possible to run a
	  MingW-compiled PostGIS against an MSVC compiled PostgreSQL and
	  pass all regression tests.

2007-12-03 23:10  pramsey

	* Fix up bad entities and screwed up programlistings from some
	  previous pretty-printing
	  run on the XML.

2007-12-02 20:37  mcayland

	* Commit updated versions of the ChangeLog and README.postgis (also
	  change some references in README.postgis from "run as root" to
	  "run as postgres", and correct the --with-pgsql and --with-geos
	  documentation)

2007-11-30 18:19  pramsey

	* Added release notes.

2007-11-30 13:04  mcayland

	* Fix the (E)WKB parser so that it performs validation checks in
	  the same way as the WKT parser, e.g. ensure POLYGON rings are
	  closed, LINESTRINGs consist of at least 2 points and that curves
	  have at least 3 points. As discovered when looking simplify() bug
	  submitted by Ivan Mincik.

2007-11-27 22:39  mcayland

	* Rename the existing get_int32() and get_uint32() functions to
	  lw_get_int32() and lw_get_uint32() respectively in order to avoid
	  a collision with functions of the same name in newer versions of
	  OS X. This should resolve the problem with PostGIS crashing on
	  some OS X installations. Many thanks to William Kyngesburye and
	  others for resolving this issue.

2007-11-27 22:19  mcayland

	* Extend the PROJ.4 search path to include
	  $sharedir/contrib/postgis/nad when looking for grid files. This
	  is mainly to allow Win32 builds to find grid files without having
	  to use a PROJ.4 DLL compiled containing a fixed path.

2007-11-23 10:42  mcayland

	* Apply Tom Glancy's patch to shp2pgsql which corrects an
	  off-by-one error in the field_width calculation when determining
	  which SQL numeric type is required depending upon the length of
	  the corresponding shapefile field. This should eliminate various
	  out of range error messages that may have appeared when
	  attempting to load a converted shapefile into PostgreSQL.

2007-11-23 10:24  mcayland

	* Commit a first attempt at an Ant build.xml file for the PostGIS
	  JDBC driver so finally all the Java drivers build with Ant for
	  consistency, plus we eliminate numerous cross platform problems.
	  As it stands, the build.xml file supports only the standard JDBC
	  driver - if you wish to use a JTS-enabled JDBC driver or run the
	  online regression tests then you must still use the Makefile. Any
	  help porting the remaining parts of the Makefile would be
	  appreciated.

2007-10-29 16:29  mcayland

	* Apply parts of Charlie Savage's MSVC patch - mainly tidying up
	  variable allocations so they appear at the start of functions,
	  but also making better use of the pj_get_errno_ref() which gets
	  rid of the auto-import warnings on MingW.

2007-10-29 14:22  mcayland

	* Remove version numbers from liblwgeom references in lwpostgis.sql
	  as per
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2007-September/002764.html.
	  This should help make upgrades a lot easier for people since it
	  removes the need to change the SQL function definitions when
	  upgrading version. Note that this is a quick and dirty fix as I
	  didn't want to change Makefile.shlib too much - as soon as we
	  remove support for PostgreSQL < 8.0, we can use PGXS instead and
	  thus remove the redundant shared library code from PostGIS.

2007-10-29 13:44  mcayland

	* Commit Charlie Savage's patches (with additional comments) to the
	  bounding box/envelope functions to ensure that valid geometries
	  are always returned; in more specific terms, if a bounding box is
	  a point then a POINT is returned, and if a bounding box is
	  1-dimensional a LINESTRING is returned. Otherwise a POLYGON is
	  returned as per the old behaviour. For details see the thread in
	  the postgis-users archives Sept 2007 'How to get the centroid of
	  an bounding box using st_extent'.

2007-10-29 12:34  mcayland

	* Fix broken error message when attempting to deserialise a type
	  other than a point; the message should now correctly show the
	  name of the offending type. Patch supplied by Charlie Savage.

2007-10-23 00:19  pramsey

	* KML credits patch <yecarrillo>

2007-10-10 21:27  mcayland

	* Apply extra fixes for the reworked AsGML() function to ensure
	  that enough memory is allocated for the GML output. Patch
	  supplied by Barbara Phillipot.

2007-09-28 10:18  mcayland

	* Fix a mistake in my refactoring of the AsGML() patch for GML3
	  support - the detoasted geometry is now the second argument
	  rather than the first. Per report from Olivier Courtin.

2007-09-19 05:01  pramsey

	* Applied patch from Charlie Savage to make ST_Envelope return a
	  POINT
	  when the input geometry is a POINT or a one-part MULTIPOINT.

2007-09-06 16:03  mcayland

	* Commit modified version of Barbara Phillipot's GML patch to fix
	  existing output to make it GML2 compliant, plus add GML3 output
	  capability

2007-08-22 15:09  pramsey

	* Rename ST_GeomUnion to ST_Union in docs and ST_MemGeomUnion to
	  ST_MemUnion in
	  .sql.

2007-08-21 23:02  mcayland

	* Fix crash when calling ST_EndPoint caused by a double-free in
	  LWGEOM_endpoint_linestring. This bug has been there for a while -
	  thanks to Eric Francois for the bug report.

2007-08-15 14:39  snowman

	* - Include levenshtein difference in rating when doing city/state
	  match.

2007-08-13 16:30  pramsey

	* Increment version number to 1.3.2 for next development cycle

2007-08-13 16:12  pramsey

	* Version flip up to 1.3.1

2007-08-13 15:51  mcayland

	* Fixed spelling error for the word "geometry" thanks to Regina
	  Obe, plus added comment about initial PostgreSQL 8.3 support.

2007-08-13 07:27  mcayland

	* This time really fix the documentation missing tag problem...

2007-08-13 07:14  mcayland

	* Fix documentation since an error in the 1.3.0 release notes xml
	  caused the build to fail (this may need author review)

2007-08-13 07:06  mcayland

	* Remove warning about unused variable in lwgeom.c (it was a
	  leftover from the PostgreSQL 8.3 compatibility patch)

2007-08-09 22:50  mleslie

	* Added release notes and updated version numbers and release
	  dates.

2007-08-09 22:19  mleslie

	* Moved the intersects method back to the original definition and
	  disabled the new apparently broken implementation.

2007-08-09 16:57  mleslie

	* Bumped the version number to RC5.

2007-08-09 16:56  mleslie

	* Updated the regression tests for curved geoms to avoid the byte
	  ordering problems.

2007-08-03 20:58  mleslie

	* Removed an unused function that was erroneously committed.

2007-08-02 19:58  mleslie

	* Added PreparedGeometry and caching support to the intersects
	  function in the jts connector. Created wrapper functions for the
	  PreparedGeometry functionality.

2007-08-02 19:57  mleslie

	* Removed a call to the deprecated point_in_ring function.

2007-07-31 20:40  mleslie

	* Updated the version numbers.

2007-07-26 18:55  mleslie

	* Applyed Michael Fuhrs patch to fix the reserved word issue
	  against PostgreSQL 8.3.

2007-07-23 21:43  mleslie

	* Fixed the FP_LTEQ macro to accomodate values significantly larger
	  that zero.

2007-07-23 18:52  mleslie

	* Added the covers and coveredby functions to the jts connector.

2007-07-23 16:29  mleslie

	* Updated the loader to create the index after the data has been
	  loaded.

2007-07-20 04:29  pramsey

	* Fix some ST_ declarations that were missing.

2007-07-18 15:57  mleslie

	* Applying Michael Fuhrs patch to correct my attrocious selling.

2007-07-16 18:53  mleslie

	* Added notes about the implicit index operators on the relational
	  functions.

2007-07-16 18:26  mleslie

	* Resurrected the ST_LineToCurve regression tests, but commented
	  them out until ST_SnapToGrid excepts curves.

2007-07-16 18:06  mleslie

	* Upgraded the escaping of quotes from the deprecated backslashing
	  to the doubling of quotes.

2007-07-13 05:48  mcayland

	* Rollback experimental shp2pgsql escaping change that accidently
	  got included in the last commit :(

2007-07-13 05:42  mcayland

	* Correct previous commit for older PostgreSQL versions - the order
	  of the methods in PROJ4SRSCacheContextMethods is not consistent
	  between versions.

2007-07-12 20:33  mcayland

	* Add missing methods to the PROJ.4 cache memory context to prevent
	  a backend crash caused by a NULL pointer dereference when
	  PostgreSQL is trying to clean up memory contexts. Per report from
	  Tom Lane.

2007-07-12 17:20  mleslie

	* Removing the unsnappable test calls to LineToCurve.

2007-07-11 01:17  pramsey

	* Remove extra/debian, per recommendation from Stephen Frost

2007-07-10 21:12  pramsey

	* Remove templategis from make, install, clean targets.

2007-07-09 03:11  snowman

	* - Remove debugging NOTICE

2007-07-09 02:20  snowman

	* - Added print-print function for norm_addy type (norm_addy ->
	  varchar)
	  - Restructured geocode(), accept address in parsed norm_addy form
	  as well as unparsed varchar form. Return norm_addy type instead
	  of
	  varchar (use pprint_addy() if you want a varchar result instead)

2007-07-08 21:56  snowman

	* - City names are 90 characters (this matters more than you might
	  think because it affects the types returned from the various
	  calls and if they don't match subsequent geocode() queries in
	  the same session may complain about the planned record type not
	  matching across calls)

2007-07-06 16:45  pramsey

	* ST_Dwithin reference entry

2007-07-06 16:44  pramsey

	* Added ST_DWithin SQL function

2007-07-04 17:12  mleslie

	* Applied the patch from Michael Fuhr to fix the definition of
	  ST_PointN

2007-07-03 21:36  snowman

	* - Change to generic database name

2007-07-03 21:36  snowman

	* - Update install instructions

2007-07-03 21:32  snowman

	* Add in initial import scripts for importing the TIGER/Line
	  data into a PostGIS system. Could probably be improved to
	  accept more arguments/etc and require less direct script
	  modification to make it work. Also, not sure the polygons
	  are done perfectly yet. :/

2007-07-03 21:30  snowman

	* Add in broken out/updated normalize/geocode functions
	  - create_geocode.sql:
	  Main creation script for pulling in all the other
	  .sql files to create all the functions and whatnot
	  - normalize/
	  Normalization routines, includes mapping 'North' -> 'N',
	  'Virginia' -> 'VA', etc, etc.
	  - geocode/
	  Actual geocoding routines to find the point geometry of the
	  address. Includes interpolation across the linestring found
	  for the location (perhaps not the best), and fallbacks to
	  zip-code and city, state matches using the associated lookup
	  tables for those. Also currently returns a set rather than
	  a cursor, that's up for some debate but the cursor makes it
	  difficult to do things like fallback, imv. Especially since
	  references to it from another pl/pgsql function require it to
	  be a specific record type across multiple calls. That's
	  currently a problem. :/

2007-07-03 21:22  snowman

	* Initial import of utility functions, seperated into individual
	  files
	  for sanity.

2007-07-03 21:19  snowman

	* tables/- New scripts for roads_local/tiger_geocode_roads, clean
	  up lookup_tables
	  - roads_local.sql:
	  Script to create the road_local table from the completechain
	  table which is created by ogr2ogr. Mainly handles type
	  conversions. Also creates the tlid, cfcc, and geometry
	  indexes.
	  
	  - tiger_geocode_roads.sql:
	  Script to create the tiger_geocode_roads table which breaks
	  down the roads_local to just the street name, etc, much
	  smaller than roads_local but has the pointers to get back
	  to the full roads_local for address number matching, etc.
	  Also creates the appropriate indexes using soundex().
	  
	  - lookup_tables.sql:
	  - Add 'drop if exists' to make script easily re-runnable
	  - Add primary keys, good thing to have, and creates indexes
	  - Add st_code (TIGER/Line state code) to state_lookup
	  - Remove dup in street_type_lookup
	  - Add in building of:
	  place_lookup
	  county_lookup
	  countysub_lookup
	  zip_lookup_all
	  zip_lookup

2007-07-03 21:05  snowman

	* - Minor reorg, add in other parts of the initial load

2007-07-03 20:51  snowman

	* - Original tiger geocoder

2007-07-03 20:03  mleslie

	* Added a home for the tiger geocoder.

2007-06-28 22:46  mleslie

	* Added ST_Covers and ST_CoveredBy functions, as discussed at
	  http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com. Added regression tests and
	  documention for the new functions.

2007-06-28 20:21  mleslie

	* Added a 1D rtree for polygon segment indexing, and tied the index
	  into the point in polygon short-circuit of the contains, within,
	  intersects and disjoint methods. Added an index cache to the
	  comparitor methods to save index build times.

2007-06-28 20:16  mleslie

	* Added or updated debugging statements.

2007-06-28 20:14  mleslie

	* Altered the macro tests for pg_alloc, pg_realloc to only print
	  debugging information when alloc debugging is enabled.

2007-06-15 19:06  mleslie

	* Updated the regression test suite to allow variable results
	  depending on jts/geos availability.

2007-06-15 19:04  mleslie

	* Added curvey geometry recognition to the jts connector.

2007-06-12 14:46  pramsey

	* Typo corrections from Michael Fuhr.

2007-06-08 10:28  mcayland

	* Applied Michael Fuhr's patch to use explicit text casts where
	  required. Required for PostgreSQL 8.3 where many of the implicit
	  casts to text have been removed.

2007-06-07 16:16  mleslie

	* Added relational function definitions that inline index operators
	  for automagic index utilization.

2007-06-06 19:19  nbarker

	* Hibernate Spatial Criteria Queries and Dialect

2007-06-05 20:46  mleslie

	* Updated the docs to reflect the function name transition.

2007-06-05 20:45  mleslie

	* Reorganized the sqlmm function declarations to prevent
	  duplication and confusion.

2007-06-04 23:06  mleslie

	* Added versions of functions with standard ST (Spatial Type)
	  prefixes to any functions that were lacking them. Updated the
	  regression tests to include the new functions.

2007-06-01 20:56  mleslie

	* Ongoing PIP trauma. Addressed the issue of points in line with a
	  boundary segment, but not actually on it. Added appropriate unit
	  tests.

2007-06-01 12:44  mcayland

	* Reduce 'LWGEOM_gist_joinsel called with arguments that are not
	  column references' warning to DEBUG1; it's not really a problem,
	  and in cases where people a lot of these types of queries, the
	  logs get flooded with these NOTICEs. Per email from Flavio Perri.

2007-06-01 09:54  mcayland

	* Fixed bug #145 - RemovePoint Failure in the bugtracker. It was an
	  off-by-one error in ptarray.c which caused the penultimate point
	  to not be copied to the new geometry.

2007-06-01 07:01  mcayland

	* Fix broken docbook stylesheet search. AC_ARG_WITH only calls its
	  contents when a --with-* option is specified, so the search would
	  never be invoked in its current position. Moved the search into
	  the second macro argument, so it is now invoked if no --with-xsl
	  argument is specified, which I believe was the intended
	  behaviour.

2007-05-31 13:18  mcayland

	* Add support for the upcoming release of PostgreSQL 8.3. From
	  PostgreSQL 8.3, the internal structure of varlena datatypes has
	  changed and so any references to the size of the varlena and its
	  address must use the VARSIZE and SET_VARSIZE macros. Includes a
	  #define in pgsql_compat.h so that SET_VARSIZE still works with
	  the older PostgreSQL versions. Passes all regression tests under
	  PostgreSQL 8.2 and PostgreSQL 8.3. Thanks to David Techer and
	  Michael Fuhr for additional testing.

2007-05-28 15:34  mleslie

	* Added 'with oids' specification to create table (oids are used
	  for the test).
	  'With oids' was available in postgresql 7.3.4 so we should not be

	  multigeoms.

2006-04-18 10:28  strk

	* Cleanly handled deserialization of points with non-point input by
	  raising an error. Made other simple geoms deserializers errors of

	  so that test works with both GEOS 2.x (w/out point spec) and 3.x
	  (with point spec)

2006-03-27 09:33  strk

	* Used a larger grid for buffer() test, to account for rounding

	  switches.

2006-02-01 20:48  strk

	* Portable tests for docdir and datadir, comments fixed.
	  Thanks to Havard Tveite for pointing out.

2006-01-29 13:54  strk

	* Fixed bug in SnapToGrid() bbox computation.
	  Previous policy (WHEN SIMPLE) turned out to be non-simple,
	  so this has been changed to TAINING.
	  Bbox will then be recomputed by scanning output coordinates
	  iff input had a bbox cache.
	  AUTOCACHE_BBOX define (the default) will still force a
	  computation of output box if worth it.
	  Regress tests added for the case reported on postgis-users
	  
	  Run of regress tests do not require postgis install
	  anymore. The library build in source tree will be
	  used for this purpose.
	  
	  Version bumped to 1.1.2 and CHANGES file updated.

2006-01-23 00:13  strk

	  for PG > 71.
	  Made update_geometry_stats(*) return meaningful result.

2004-06-03 09:45  strk

	* infinite geoms handled in WKB parser

2004-06-03 08:19  strk

	* yet another Infinite check used: finite() - which checks for
	  NaN,-Inf,+Inf

2004-06-03 08:13  strk

	* Simplified INFINITY checks by use of isinf()

2004-06-03 07:58  strk

2004-06-01 16:30  strk

	* Made AddGeometryColumn delete from geometry_column records which
	  would be incompatible with the one being added

2004-06-01 16:16  strk

	* Placed histogram2d type definition in a common place;
	  added find_extent(schema, table, column) and
	  build_histogram2d(histogram,
	  schema, table, column); modified update_geometry_stats() to make
	  use
	  of available f_table_schema and to set statistical fields to NULL
	  for stale records. Thanks to Carl Anderson for the ideas.

	  This way we are not affected by shapelib long-integer bug.

2004-05-13 12:07  strk

	* Other fix in 3d handling - you should now be able to dump as 2d
	  or 3d any 2d or 3d object

2004-05-13 11:59  strk

	* Fixed bug in 3d features handling.

2004-04-08 17:05  dblasby

	* Somehow the memory leak changes I made got removed - I've
	  re-added them.

2004-04-08 17:00  dblasby

	* Changed ggeometry_consistent to be aware of NULL queries. Ie.
	  select * from <table> where the_geom && null::geometry;
	  
	  This tends to happen when you're joining two tables using && and
	  the table
	  has NULLs in it.

2004-04-07 23:12  dblasby

	* Added a cstring(lwgeom) function that returns WKT!

	  postgis09=# select fluffType('POINT(0 0)');
	  flufftype
	  -------------------------
	  SRID=-1;MULTIPOINT(0 0)

2004-03-25 00:43  dblasby

	* added function fluffType() that takes POINT LINESTRING or POLYGON
	  type and converts it to a multi*.
	  Needs to be integrated into a proper Postgresql function and
	  given an
	  SQL CREATE FUNCTION

2004-03-22 09:39  strk

	* Moved AddGeometryColumn and DropGeometryColumn from USE_VERSION
	  blocks to the end of file. Here, differences between versions

	* Made the -bps switch specify the exact level(s) at which to run
	  the test

2004-03-05 18:25  dblasby

	* Empty files - preparing for writting actual code.

2004-03-05 18:23  dblasby

	* Same as the one in the above directory

	* postgis_gist_sel(): added warnings if search_box goes outside of
	  histogram grid

2004-03-04 09:44  strk

	* The selectivity estimator does add the full value of each cell it
	  overlaps,
	  regardless of the actual overlapping area. Final gain is not
	  applied
	  (formerly 1 / minimun between average feature cells occupation
	  and
	  search_box cells occupation)

2004-03-03 21:59  strk

	* added check to keep selectivity value in the range of validity

	  'MULTIPOINT( (0 0), (1 1))'::geometry;

2002-10-24 15:53  pramsey

	* Added PGbox3d accessors for LLB and URB. Added PGgeometry update
	  to
	  account for SRIDs when they are present in the WKT. Submitted by
	  Rueben Schultz.

2002-10-17 17:06  chodgson

	* fixed the last compile warning on solaris/gcc

2002-10-17 16:45  chodgson

	* - cleaned up all the compiler warnings
	  - for getopt.c, this involved moving the line:
	  extern char *getenv(const char *name);
	  outside of the two nested #ifdefs that it was inside, as it is
	  always required (the code that calls it isn't inside any #ifdefs)
	  Perhaps this may break compilation in non-linux/gnu environments?

2002-05-06 17:35  chodgson

	* - changed add_to_geometry() and collector() so that the sql

	  support
	  added to Makefile.

2002-05-04 22:44  pramsey

	* Add commenting to indicate the coordinate system of each insert
	  line in

	* Start of 0.7 documenation edits.

2002-05-02 22:25  dblasby

	* transform_geom() - if it gets and error -38 from PROJ.4 (couldnt
	  open
	  grid file) it will try to do the transform without a
	  a datum conversion. This usually occurs if you ask
	  for a re-projection for a point outside where you have
	  grid data for.

2002-04-30 23:37  dblasby

	* Better error reporting.

2002-04-30 23:20  dblasby

	* Added some debugging to transform.

2002-04-29 17:23  dblasby

	* Added distance_ellipsiod(point,point,ellipsoid)
	  (called distance_spheroid in SQL)

2002-04-26 22:50  chodgson

	* - cut the gist indexing-related functions out of postgis_ops.c
	  and put them in postgis_gist.c, then put the new gist indexing
	  functions for postgres >= 7.2 in the file postgis_gist_72
	  
	  - similarly, the sql definitions of the gist functions have been
	  split into their own new sql.in file, with postgis_gist_72.sql.in
	  containing the new postgres >= 7.2 definitions
	  
	  - the makefile has been updated to compile EITHER postgis_gist.c
	  OR postgis_gist_72.c, and also to process EITHER
	  postgis_gist.sql.in OR postgis_gist_72.sql and add the output to
	  the end of postgis.sql
	  
	  - in order to compile the gist functions for posgres 7.2 or
	  newer, make sure to point your PGSQL_SRC at the new source
	  directory, and uncomment the line in the makefile which says PG72
	  = 1 (near the top)
	  
	  - some functions that were previously in postgis_ops.c were moved
	  to postgis_fn.c, as part of a general cleanup I did when
	  splitting off the gist functions into their own file
	  
	  - some definitions that were previously in postgis.h
	  (unnecessarily) where removed, as they varied depending on which
	  version of postgis_gist was being used
	  
	  - also edited the loader/Makefile to clean up properly

2002-04-26 16:13  pramsey

	* Column name length limitation removed. Patch submitted by

	* Added the collect(geometry) function which is an aggregate
	  function that
	  takes a group of geometries and turns them into a geometry
	  collection. For
	  example, "select collect(roadsgeom) from roadstable group by
	  roadname"
	  would return one geometrycollection for each unique road name.

2002-03-15 17:10  dblasby

	* ADD xmin(box3d) etc... for box3d's.

2002-03-14 19:35  jeffloun

2002-03-01 19:32  pramsey

	* Alter shp2pgsql in the -d case so that 'DELETE FROM' is used to
	  clear the
	  'GEOMETRY_COLUMNS' table during table drop instead of
	  DropGeometryColumns.
	  Patch submitted by Steffen Macke <sdteffen@yahoo.com>.

2002-02-27 00:38  dblasby

	* minor bug in geometry_to_text() for BOX3D only types fixed.

2002-02-27 00:06  dblasby

	* for bbox only geometries, it will dump as "SRID=x;NULL", and on
	  load, it will be NULL.

2002-02-23 19:04  pramsey

	  geometry
	  column, and addition of -g option to specific which geometry

	  numgeometries(geometry) works on MULTI* types
	  geometryn(geometry) works on MULTI* types
	  
	  
	  from section 2.1.5.1
	  --------------------
	  startpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  first
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  endpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  last
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  from section 2.1.9.1/3.2.18.2
	  --------------------
	  
	  centroid(geometry) :- if geometry is a polygon (or multipolygon),
	  return
	  the mathematical centroid (no guaranteed to be on polygon),
	  otherwise
	  return NULL. I define centroid as the average location of all the
	  points
	  in the polygon (outer ring only). For multipolygons, average all
	  the
	  points on all the outer rings.
	  
	  from section 3.2.12.2/3.2.17.2
	  ---------------------
	  isclosed(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring then returns
	  startpoint == endpoint. If its not a linestring then return NULL.
	  If
	  its a multilinestring, return true only if all the
	  sub-linestrings have
	  startpoint=endpoint.

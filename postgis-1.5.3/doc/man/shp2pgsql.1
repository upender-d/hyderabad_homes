shp2pgsql - shapefile to postgis loader

.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
shp2pgsql [\fIoptions\fR] \fIshapefile\fR [\fIschema\fR\fB.\fR]\fItable\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The shp2pgsql data loader converts ESRI Shape files into SQL suitable 
for insertion into a PostGIS/PostgreSQL database. 

Version: 1.1.5 (2006/10/06)

.SH "USAGE"
.LP
The <shapefile> is the name of the shape file, without any extension
information. For example, 'roads' would be the name of the shapefile 
comprising the 'roads.shp', 'roads.shx', and 'roads.dbf' files.

The <tablename> is the (optionally schema-qualified) name of the database 
table you want the data stored in in the database. Within that table, 
the geometry will be placed in the 'geo_value' column by default.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
The loader has several operating modes distinguished by command line flags:

(Note that -a, -c, -d and -p are mutually exclusive.)
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
Drops the database table before creating a new table with the data in the 
Shape file.
.TP 
\fB\-a\fR
Appends data from the Shape file into the database table. Note that to use
this option to load multiple files, the files must have the same attributes 
and same data types.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR
Creates a new table and populates it from the Shape file. This is the default 
mode.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR
Only produces the table creation SQL code, without adding any actual data. 
This can be used if you need to completely separate the table creation and 
data loading steps.
.TP 
\fB\-D\fR
Use the PostgreSQL "dump" format for the output data. This can be combined 
with -a, -c and -d. It is much faster to load than the default "insert" SQL
format. Use this for very large data sets.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR <\fISRID\fR>
Creates and populates the geometry tables with the specified SRID.
.TP 
\fB\-g\fR <\fIgeometry_column\fR>
Specify the name of the geometry column (mostly useful in append mode).
.TP 
\fB\-k\fR
Keep idendifiers case (column, schema and attributes). Note that attributes 
in Shapefile are usually all UPPERCASE.
.TP 
\fB\-i\fR
Coerce all integers to standard 32\-bit integers, do not create 64\-bit 
bigints, even if the DBF header signature appears to warrant it.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fR
Generate simple Geometries instead of MULTIgeometries. Shape files don't 
differ between LINESTRINGs and MULTILINESTRINGs, so shp2pgsql generates 
MULTILINESTRINGs by default. This switch will produce LINESTRINGs instead, 
but shp2pgsql will fail when it hits a real MULTILINESTRING. The same works
for POLYGONs vs. MULTIPOLYGONs.
.TP 
\fB\-w\fR
Output WKT format, for use with older (0.x) versions of PostGIS.
Note that this will introduce coordinate drifts and will drop
M values from shapefiles.
.TP 
\fB\-W\fR <\fIencoding\fR>
Specify the character \fIencoding\fR of Shapefile's attributes.
If this option is used the output will be encoded in UTF-8.
.TP 
\fB\-I\fR
Create a GiST index on the geometry column. 
.TP 
\fB\-N\fR <\fIpolicy\fR>
Specify NULL geometries handling policy (insert,skip,abort).
.TP 
\fB\-?\fR
Display version and usage information.

.SH "INSTALLATION"
.LP
To compile the program from source, simply run "make" in the source directory.
Then copy the binary in your shell search path (or wherever you like). This
text is also available as a man page in the ../doc/man/ directory, ready for
copying it into the manual search path on unixoid systems.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
An example session using the loader to create an input file and uploading it 
might look like this:

# \fBshp2pgsql shaperoads roadstable roadsdb > roads.sql\fR
.br 
# \fBpsql \-d roadsdb \-f roads.sql\fR

A conversion and upload can be done all in one step using UNIX pipes:

# \fBshp2pgsql shaperoads roadstable roadsdb | psql \-d roadsdb\fR

This application uses functionality from shapelib 1.2.9
